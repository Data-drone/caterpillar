5,Christchurch,RANGIORA,convenient to work and nice staff,I needed two tyres and thought the quote given was for two tyres. I paid double what I had been lead to believe so frankly I felt mislead.  The vehicle had been in 6 weeks earlier for a wheel balance and the staff had not mentioned that two tyres needed replacing.,,1

8,Christchurch,CHRISTCHURCH - HORNBY,Nothing you are a pack of theives.,How you guys can charge that sort of price for a new tyre is beyond me.I will never use you company again and as i run a business in hornby i will be mentioing the prices you charge and informing all my customers as well as staff and friends. Because i sent my wife down your staff feel they can just charge anything they want. Dont you stock all types of tyres??,Get it right and stop ripping people off,1
9,Northland ,KERIKERI,customer service from website was good. ,The tyres arranged weren't in stock ..  ONE OF THE BRAND NEW TYRES FITTED WENT FLAT THE NEXT DAY AND PAUL CARSON-WENMOTH  HAD TO CALL ROADSIDE RESCUE AT 9PM LAST NIGHT ON HIS WAY BACK TO AUCKLAND. NOT VERY HAPPY. ,,1

11,Bay of Plenty,TAURANGA - Cameron Road,I could get my wheels aligned at the same time as replacing my 2 front tyres . A lot of other shops would only do that if I made an appointment. Also I could use my gold card which was quite a saving.,Nothing ,I was quite satisfied with the service I received.,1
12,Auckland,AUCKLAND - SILVERDALE,Nothing,Neither of the guys who answered could be bothered helping me.  I eventually called through to Glenfield where they couldn't have been more helpful and sorted out the quote and arranged for delivery straight away.,,1
13,Christchurch,CHRISTCHURCH - HORNBY,Friendly Service,The price. After I paid for mine an older gentleman came in and asked for a discount which he was given (quite a decent amount too) felt that was a bit on the nose and exemplified the stereotype that women get charged more in regards to car repairs/tyres.,Be more discreet about discounts to new customers when  previous customer have already paid full price or offer the previous customer the same discount.,1
14,Auckland,AUCKLAND - KINGSLAND,The tyres were good,For Warrant purposes I needed 2 tyres. I filled in the form and came back the next morning (9.15am) my van was taken into the shop immediately (great service) 10.35am I drove out (why so long to change two tyres).  Not happy,Speed up the way they change the tyres.  No wheel alignment was given or additional services.,1
15,Hawke's Bay,WAIPUKURAU,nothing,didnt have a clue about what was going on left with no new tyre,better communication between phone rep and stores,1
