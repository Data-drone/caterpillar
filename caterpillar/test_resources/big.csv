4,Auckland,AUCKLAND - HOWICK,Changed our tyres efficiently without any fuss and advised us to go back in 6 weeks to check the tyres.  Advised us that we did not need alignment done so everything good!,,,1
5,Christchurch,RANGIORA,convenient to work and nice staff,I needed two tyres and thought the quote given was for two tyres. I paid double what I had been lead to believe so frankly I felt mislead.  The vehicle had been in 6 weeks earlier for a wheel balance and the staff had not mentioned that two tyres needed replacing.,,1

7,Auckland,AUCKLAND - MANUKAU CITY,Very profesional with great knowledge of tyres well explained to me.,Nothing to grumble about,Very happy with service provided,1
8,Christchurch,CHRISTCHURCH - HORNBY,Nothing you are a pack of theives.,How you guys can charge that sort of price for a new tyre is beyond me.I will never use you company again and as i run a business in hornby i will be mentioing the prices you charge and informing all my customers as well as staff and friends. Because i sent my wife down your staff feel they can just charge anything they want. Dont you stock all types of tyres??,Get it right and stop ripping people off,1
9,Northland ,KERIKERI,customer service from website was good. ,The tyres arranged weren't in stock ..  ONE OF THE BRAND NEW TYRES FITTED WENT FLAT THE NEXT DAY AND PAUL CARSON-WENMOTH  HAD TO CALL ROADSIDE RESCUE AT 9PM LAST NIGHT ON HIS WAY BACK TO AUCKLAND. NOT VERY HAPPY. ,,1

11,Bay of Plenty,TAURANGA - Cameron Road,I could get my wheels aligned at the same time as replacing my 2 front tyres . A lot of other shops would only do that if I made an appointment. Also I could use my gold card which was quite a saving.,Nothing ,I was quite satisfied with the service I received.,1
12,Auckland,AUCKLAND - SILVERDALE,Nothing,Neither of the guys who answered could be bothered helping me.  I eventually called through to Glenfield where they couldn't have been more helpful and sorted out the quote and arranged for delivery straight away.,,1
13,Christchurch,CHRISTCHURCH - HORNBY,Friendly Service,The price. After I paid for mine an older gentleman came in and asked for a discount which he was given (quite a decent amount too) felt that was a bit on the nose and exemplified the stereotype that women get charged more in regards to car repairs/tyres.,Be more discreet about discounts to new customers when  previous customer have already paid full price or offer the previous customer the same discount.,1
14,Auckland,AUCKLAND - KINGSLAND,The tyres were good,For Warrant purposes I needed 2 tyres. I filled in the form and came back the next morning (9.15am) my van was taken into the shop immediately (great service) 10.35am I drove out (why so long to change two tyres).  Not happy,Speed up the way they change the tyres.  No wheel alignment was given or additional services.,1

16,Auckland,AUCKLAND - NEW LYNN (Gt North Rd),Prompt friendly service.,Went in for an Alignment. Did the alignment but on driving back to Napier both front tyres wore out and actually blew out! Tread right down to the steel on both tyres. Had to get a tow from Tawarea to Napier costing $276.00. Your staff didn't notice the worn bush in the steering that made any alignment only temporary. Very expensive exercise and potentially dangerous...,,1
17,Bay of Plenty,ROTORUA - AMOHAU ST,Quick service and friendly team member,All good,I have asked that the receipt be forwarded to me with a comment on what was done (re Nail n tyre) and as yet have not received any thing back,1
18,Otago,DUNEDIN - CUMBERLAND ST,Friendly,Charged a forture to fix a flat tyre to which other company have never charged anything. forgot to put cover back onwheel and had to drive all the way back with a vey tired toodler. and a weird thing ig is my speedo seems to be out now.,all other places i have purchased tyre from fix puncures free of charge. $30+  to fix a punture is a rip off.,1
19,Wellington,WELLINGTON - PORIRUA - PARUMOANA ST,Outstanding service and reasonably priced.,Everything was good. Nothing to dislike,,1
20,Waikato,HAMILTON - TE RAPA,,My parents who are from out of town got a flat tyre and visited the store and recieved very rude service and directed them to another tyre repair store who is apparently able to fix the tyre. It was not explained why they were unable to repair the tyre. I rang up to inquire as to why it was unable to be repaired and this was explained as it had a side hole (something along those lines) and was illegal to repair. The man was very aggressive on the phone and I explained that the the reason why it was unable to repaired was not explained. I then said that I was finding his tone quite agreesive and asked his name he said' Forget it: and hung up. I would expect better more professional service than this from your store and would be hesitant in recommending or using your services if this is indicative of customer service. I would appreciate a response to this email.,,1
21,Tararua,DANNEVIRKE,Actually visited Pahiatua - looks like you have already canned it so not sure what the survey is actually about. - A WASTE OF TIME,,,1
22,Otago,QUEENSTOWN,The prices of tyres.,Went into the branch for a price on tyres for my car and to my dismay the gentleman who was sitting in the chair with his feet on the counter acting like it was a lazyboy did not seem interested in serving me so the other guy who was beside this guy checked my car for size of tyre.Then while putting numbers in there system he seemed to be distracted in talking about sport or something that the other gentleman was looking at on the other computer.After i had been given a price i was asked how many i needed and i replied i was not too sure and if  you be able to check for me as i will be driving to Auckland...he called out to another guy who was working with another customer on the floor to check my tyres and get back to him while he went and sat back down..I went out to my car with this young gentleman who was so helpful that he checked all my pressures while going around the car and leaving the customer he was serving he got the price for 4 tyres and explained i would also need a wheel alignment which was very helpful.He could do it straight away for me as the stock was there but they seemed not that busy but the guy laid back in his own world said a booking needed to be made which did surprise the young guy who was so keen in getting it done.After an awful experience I found a far better service from another company. ,Customer Service does not seem to be a Priority at this branch and how tough it is in the tyre Industry just showed me it does pay to shop around.,1
23,Waikato,HAMILTON - TE RAPA,Prompt service,Misunderstanding of quoted price. I asked for price for two 4x4 tyres plus wheel alignment. given a price which I thought was good value arranged to go in. When I went to pay for the work I found out the tyre price was for each tyre not for both which I thought. Hence was very disappointed.,Always give total price when asked,1
24,Auckland,AUCKLAND - HENDERSON,The fly buys discount. ,They forgot to take the $20 discount per tyre off. (I bought 2 new.) Which i didn't realise till I got home. Which was a 20min drive away and i had bypassed my local firestone to use the voucher. The manager/owner then argued with me about it trying to say it was only for a certain tyre even though the voucher clearly said $20 off EACH tyre. No brand name was written on voucher.,i wont be using beaurepairs again. next time I'll take the voucher in to my local firestone and ask them to do same discount.,1
25,Otago,DUNEDIN - CUMBERLAND ST,Location was close to work,Hidden extras,,1
26,Christchurch,CHRISTCHURCH - NORTHWOOD,The service was good. I was not impressed receiving your discount voucher and double fly buys from the W.O.F the day after purchasing aI tyre and they would not accept it .,,I would have thought they could have given the discount.,1
27,Northland ,WHANGAREI - 73 REYBURN ST,Nothing,Asked for a quote on line 15/07/12. No reply. Waste of time.,,1

30,Auckland,AUCKLAND - EAST TAMAKI,Quick service and after service query,Service. After the alignment steering wheel got on one side and the guy blamed it on tyres. If it was tyres would have been like that even before alignment. ,Would have been a recheck on the alignment. Was told about it but no effort was made to do so really,2
31,Hawke's Bay,NAPIER - CARLYLE ST,Friendly and seems to have done a good job,$30 seems a bit excessive as the competition fix's punctures for free. Thought I would try beaurepairs as the location was suitable. ,Would be good to offered or told about other services and deals.,2
32,Bay of Plenty,MOUNT MAUNGANUI - HULL ROAD,the fly buys ,i had hassles as soon as i walked in the door! i was a pre approved now finance customer had the print out all i was told to do is hand over the print out and they will do the rest so easy as that . Not so !Paul Langdon  was rude lazy and did nothing but winge that he had to process this said that he was not Beaurepaires he was carters even tho it said beaurepaires on the front of the shop as does may contract as does my reciept.  I had to come back the next day to fit tyres when i rang to see if the tyres were there he then said the computers was down so come in at 2.30pm. i arrived early it still took 1 hr and 15 mins. i was handed my contract so i attempted to check it by reading it told its just a contract just sign. i said i have the right to read it thank you.  i still don't know if the tyres i got are the ones quoted such a bad experience  !!! ,some one to ring me back asap!!!!!! I want my Tyre price checked i would like this  guy Paul Langdon to hear this complaint and to make sure it is triple fly buys as i was told today  ,2
33,Auckland,AUCKLAND - TAKANINI,Prompt service,Initially they declined to give bonus fly buys on puncture repair as said it only applied to purchases. Took a long time to sort it out which was annoying as I was then late to get to work.,All staff should be aware of bonus offers,2
34,Manawatu,LEVIN,The service was fast and efficient explained tyre differences.,Nothing,The service seems to be working fine.,2
35,Wellington,WELLINGTON - PARAPARAUMU,They fitted me in quickly and repaired the tyre quickly,The tyre exploded on SH1 just outside Sanson causing my vehicle to swerve violently towards the ditch and hit a roadside post before I overcorrected into the oncoming line of traffic (fortunately nothing coming) and back onto the grass verge on the left.  The AA came and changed tyre but screw holding one of the nuts sheared when they tried to take the tyre off.,,2
36,Christchurch,RANGIORA,,quoted $200 then when came 2 pay it was $200 plus gst,,2
37,Bay of Plenty,ROTORUA - TE NGAE RD,Not much,Very poor customer service....this branch has been steadily going downhill on customer service front.,This branch needs to get staff who enjoy dealing with people and who smile and are welcoming.,2
38,Christchurch,DARFIELD,Convenient location,When I arrived tyres agreed going on weren't in stock.  No phone call to warn me.  Had to change my tyre choice which was annoying.  Still no follow up call on a further enquiry.  Not the service I would expect from Beaurepaires.,Review operations at this franchise. I doubt I'll go back there.,2
39,Bay of Plenty,WHAKATANE,Good communication,,,2
40,Auckland,AUCKLAND - HOWICK,Price and initial service was good,I took time off work the friday morning and walk down to howick for a cofee. They told me it would take about an hour which was fine. I gave them cell phone number for them to call me. It was close to 1 45 mins later still no word so i called them and said yes car was ready. I then asked the guy while paying how long it had been ready for he said about 50 mins he said the other guy forgot to call me to tell me it was ready. I left the place wild to say the least and never wish to return. ,Call your customers when the vehicle is readyy,2

46,Northland ,WHANGAREI - WATER ST,The manager listened to my complaint & offered a solution/compromise.,The fact that I had been left to drive around on increasingly unsafe tyres since my previous visit. And it took the local Ford dealership mechanic to identify that the problem with the steering was due to the tyres being overworn.,,3

49,Wellington,WELLINGTON - NEWTOWN,service was very good.,on the 30/11/2012 my wife was in Wellington and got a puncture.  She was informed that the nail had gone through the side wall and they couldn't match they tyre for the opposite side.  She was then told by your representative that she should purchase two tyres and proceeded to tell her that he wouldn't put anything less than Dunlop SP Sport 2050 on the car at the cost of $406 each not including balancing and alignment..  My wife was a little stressed as the incident was likely to cause her to miss our son's final so felt pressured to just except this advice. I have never had any trouble with tyres in the $200 range and it seems that your representative has taken advantage of my wife's situation,????,3
50,Wellington,WELLINGTON - PARAPARAUMU,friendly and quick,I thought the price quoted was all  up not per tyre,Please specify per tyre when quoting,3

54,Bay of Plenty,TAURANGA - Cameron Road,They were efficient,I had to purchase 2 new tyres for a WOF.  I was quoted $328 for 2 Hankooks which i was happy with.  When I came to pay i presented a $50 Beaurepaires gift voucher as part payment and was told I couldn't use it because the tyres had already been discounted and the system couldn't accept it and that I should have let them kow I was using it before purcahasing the tyres.  I pointed out it wasn't a discount voucher but a gift voucher and I should be able to use it for any portion of any purchase. They refused but offered me a discounted wheel alignemnt for $60 which i didn't want or need.  However as the voucher ran out on 1/11/12 i felt forced to accept it. Not good servic ein my view sorry. ,,3

62,Wellington,LOWER HUTT - RUTHERFORD ST,The work they did was quite good.,Went in on a saturday and they overcharged me by $100 on my eftpos. Its now thursday and I still havent seen the refund come through. It shouldnt take 4-5 business working days to do a simple $100 bank deposit/refund.   ,Most retail/ service outlets nowadays have a merchant eftpos card which can be used to put money straight back onto someones card. That would have been amazing compared to being out of pocket by $100 for a whole working week. ,4
63,Hawke's Bay,HASTINGS - HERETAUNGA ST,Nice quick service ,On or way home we lost 3 of our 4 hub caps due to them not been put on properly.,Zip tiring the hub caps of!,4

66,Waikato,TE AWAMUTU,service and price was ok.,The wheel nuts on the right front wheel were not tightened properly. I heard a noise luckily at below 50 km/h and returned to the shop. It could have lead to a nasty accident at higher speed!,,4

68,Otago,DUNEDIN - CUMBERLAND ST,I liked getting new tyres at a reasonable price,I didn't like that I was booked in for 10am and when I arrived I was told that it would take over an hour. I had planned to just wait while it was done but instead I had to make my own way back to work wasting more of my time. I would have expected this if I had just rocked up to the store but being booked in I was expecting it to be done at that time. ,,4

71,Auckland,AUCKLAND - EAST TAMAKI,,I had booked an appointment at the East Tamaki Branch on Saturday. When I got there I was told that the store did not hold those tyres. I had to re-schedule my appointment with another store on Monday and I felt that this was very incompetent especially if you are promoting loyalty and online bookings. No compensation was offered for this debacle as I had to take time off work to go on a monday to have the job done.,I would like to see better communication to gain loyalty towards your brand.,4
72,Bay of Plenty,ROTORUA - AMOHAU ST,,they put the wrong size tyre on the warrant place wouldnt give me a warrant so had to go back so they could put the right one on. Not good enough Beaurepaires......,,4

97,Manawatu,PALMERSTON NTH - 559 TREMAINE AVE,helpful at booking centre. good price for tires. can use farmlands card.,not convinced by being told that front bearings were too loose to adjust. the right one was looked at recently by my garage and not considered a problem. when i phoned the garage and told them what work had been recommended they thought it was a bit strange. last time i was there the left hand thread was tightened not loosened and i had to take it to the garage to be sorted out so i don't have much confidence in the wheel alignment service any more.,,5
98,Otago,DUNEDIN - ANDERSONS BAY RD,,We booked our vehicle in for a wheel alignment and balance and when turning up they recommended we get 4 new tyres as it wouldnt pass the next warrant.  The annoying thing about this is we paid for the 4 news tyres on this saturday and then on the monday it was advertised buy 3 new tyres get the 4th for free - that could of saved us $350.

And have been given advice on how to keep the wear of my tires down.,I didnt get a phone call when my car was finished. I had to phone them.

114,Wellington,WELLINGTON - KENT TERRACE,Ability to book online. Competitive pricing. Didn't have to wait. Blacked tires.,Hard sell TOO MUCH! Put me off returning. Told me another tire was needing replaced and needed alignment. I declined and took to Honda for a WOF next day as was due anyway. They passed the car AND tires with no new tire required and no alignment required. So who do I believe? -Honda. The car would not have got a WOF if in fact what Beaurepaires staff said was accurate and that I needed a new tire.,Loosen up on the hard sell - it's not McDonalds. I found it intimidating as a woman taking the car in alone.,5
115,Auckland,AUCKLAND - BROWNS BAY,Your service guy came out to me when I was getting my baby out of the car to serve me.  He then brought the form out of the office so I didn't have to try and get the pram inside which was helpful.,My husband had made the reservation for me and asked for the two front tyres to be replaced.  When I got there the service guy said they had been told 4 tyres.  I said no definately only the front two at this stage.  He came across as almost argumentative. ,I am not sure if someone in the office passed on an incorrect info (he said the booking was under lada) or not but feel a little bit of customer service training may have gone a long way in how the service guy spoke to me.  I am in customer service myself and know how hard it can be to get a team all trained  up but when they get it right - it is impressive.,5
116,Otago,DUNEDIN - ANDERSONS BAY RD,They offered to replace the spare tyre I had put on with the repaired punctured one after it was fixed.,They lost the piece that securees my spare back in the boot. This email reminded me that they still havent rung to say if they found it.,My lost part to be found or replaced.,5
117,Waikato,HAMILTON - TE RAPA,friendly enough did the job straight away,the price $31,maybe smile a bit more,5
118,Auckland,AUCKLAND - KINGSLAND,Friendly Staff.  Flexible in terms of booking time.,Was told that I must have given wrong tyre size which is why I had to wait another day for it to be ordered.  Told that the front tyre which was replaced at Beaurepairs Kingsland in  December 2011 needed replacing as well as the one the other front tyre that I'd gone in for.  Quoted $245 per tyre.  Found the invoice from Dec and realised I'd only paid $160 for the tyre recommended then.  Told a wheel alignment would be done but was not told that would incur and extra charge.  Pricing is not transparent or clearly communicated when job is booked.  Frustrated as when I got home saw that Goodyear tyres had been put on however I hadn't been told the brand name so didn't think that I could use my $20 off per tyre email voucher that I'd recieved from VTNZ for use at Beaurepairs - most annoying as that's what made me phone thinking I could save.  Asked to use my 25 bonus point flybuy offer on each tyre but told I could only use for the one invoice.  Asked to be invoiced twice and told not possible.,Price expect to pay including GST and recommended wheel alignment should be clearly outlined.  Flybuy point redemption should also be made clear.  Full brand name of tyre recommended should be given so that any offers can be taken advantage of.  I assume that a customer's history is kept on file so an explanation of difference in tyre recommendation should be provided.  I only searched out the old invoice as I went in expecting to pay for 1 tyre and then had to pay $580 for two and was sure that Beaurepairs had done the one they were recommending to be replaced less than 12 months ago - as was the case!  Feel that as I looked a flustered mother with twins crying in the car demanding attention that perhaps the wool was pulled over my eyes?,5
119,Auckland,AUCKLAND - NEW LYNN (Gt North Rd),great service,didn't put the tyre on properly,,5

So we had to go back the next day & get this fault corrected.  This sort of thing shouldn't happen and was only picked up the next day when the inventory didn't match.

Happy to be given the options on which to make my own decision.,Was considering buying 4 tyres but decided to purchase two now with two in about a month's time. The tyres purchased were Fuelmax.  Was given a discount via the DHB discount scheme.  I had no downside message to put in until I came on to this website to discover the deal of purchasing three of the Fuelmax tyres and the fourth was free.  I was not informed of this deal.  The discount obtained from this deal would have been much better than the DHB discount scheme.  It would have been nice to know this was an option and how to obtain it (website voucher).  Now I can not take advantage of this deal as the instructions indicate it had to be all on one invoice.  Somewhat disappointed at this.,Fully inform customers of current deals even if the customer has to go home and obtain a voucher off the website.,8

879,Waikato,HAMILTON - CITY,I appreciate the straight talking I have received from your Dinsdale and city stores about price and situation. I notice your Dinsdale store has changed hands. The woman there was excellent value to your company Generally your prices are competitive. I admire your quest to encourage customer feedback to drive improvement.,I had a tyre insurance and a screw had inserted itself in the tyre. the tyre was still in excellent condition (tread)  but would not hold air.  The insurance was of no value to me as the tyre had been driven some distance with very low inflation. This was because it took a little time to discover the low tyre and get it to a service station to put air in and then seal it with a spray product. Even if the tyre was changed immediately the tyre would still have been driven on low air. It seems to me that in most cases the tyre insurance does not really advantage the customer significantly. I bought a replacement tyre from the store identified above. ,I suggest that in the case of a tyre puncture or leak that where there were reasonable circumstances involving the tyre being driven while deflated and the tyre insurance had been purchased that there be a special discount for the replacement. I do not expect that the tyre be replace for no cost but a sharing of cost to replace would be more attractive to the customer. ,8

3669,Wellington,LOWER HUTT - VICTORIA ST,I was early for my appointment and just a few minutes after I arrived I got a warm welcome and invited in and shown the coffee machine.  All the time I was there I was kept informed of progress and I was happily reading a magazine.   The estimated time to fit the 2 rear tyres was 40 minutes and that was about the time it took but they also fitted the best tyre on to the spare and checked the battery.     When it came to the paying piece I had the insurance explained in a manner that I could understand and then I was on my way with all 4 tyres painted and all looking new and beautiful.,There was nothing I didn't like.   I hadn't been looking forward to doing this as in most garages etc. a woman gets talked at and not really taken notice of.    On this occassion that did not happen.,No suggestions necessary.  Keep up the good work,10

Since the wheel alignment the tracking is good and the steering is without any of the previous pull to the left. The price was better than expected. Overall - excellent - exceeding expectations.,It took about 30 minutes before the job was started but I was not too concerned as I had an appointment at the medical center opposite.,The coffee machine did not offer any option that I wanted but I was impressed by being offered the use of the staff-room to make what I wanted in a proper cup.

3978,Auckland,AUCKLAND - WAIUKU,The guy that helped us was very friendly and approachable.  He showed a good amount of knowledge and offered different options and advised us of costings.  He asked if i had flybuys which was good because i didn't even think about flybuys.  He also fitted us in to put tyres on the car and did the wheel alignment promptly.  Great friendly experience.  He also advised they did warrants which i wasn't aware of.,Nothing i didn't like it was a great experience and would recommend them and will be returning to use them again,They have a great big sign outside which states what they do and i drive past there quite frequently and even though it states everything they do i always think they just do tyres.  They offer a wide range of services and if there is some other way of letting people know just how much they do ie: mailouts or something(open day to come and see?) it might increase business.  You think the sign would be enough but when you are driving you notice the big word but not enough time driving past to read the this is what we do part,10

4571,Auckland,AUCKLAND - GLEN INNES (Apirana Ave),The store was Panmure.  Didn't seem to be a Panmure choice. Sally at reception couldn't have been more receptive and with a friendly manner.  The guys who worked on the car seemed a 'happy at work' bunch.  I was duly notified of any special needs that needed to be carried out for my confirmation.  Even the price was good.,The only thing was that just the week before I had purchased 2 new rear tyres which had been balanced at that time.    Sally informed me on my return to pick up the car that the tyres had been rotated and that was fine with me but maybe I should have told her that they were new.  She did explain to me that it was better to have the new tyres on the front.  ,,10

I have gone to Beaurepairs many times but no one has done more than give me the brochure.  The staff member who worked on my car was also thorough as Anthony was on the phone when he came top get my car.  So as i had left the quote at home he checked the car himself then confirmed with Anthony before beginning work.
