Email - We're always looking for ways to improve the service we provide.
"policy schedule not available, no detail as where to send the NCB confirmation to either. Very poor post sale service."
Complete redesign of you website. Consistant pricing with price comparison site.
The policy should include travelling to a place of work/study. Received a call to find out that I am not covered and had to pay extra. Very dissappointed.
You should make it a lot clearer on your website that your 0% payment offer for gadget insurance requires a loan and therefore credit check managed by a third party.
It needs to be made explicit whether or not the NCD proof can be sent by email. I am still waiting for a response on that.
medical conditions of more than 2 years do they need to be added if no current problems hospital app. or medication wasnt clear
"No where on application did it state that third party cover for other vehicles was not included,Only when I had paid in full and viewed the cert, was i aware there wasnt cover."
"Only load the initial quote, do not load other items that are not wanted, of course offer the choice to add to policy, but DO NOT LOAD them automatically.  Furthermore tell people at the start of the quote that there will be a small fee for using a credit card, rather than at the end of the transaction."
Some points were not entirely clear i.e. 'has your medication changed in the last 12 months'  Whilst answering honestly you do not say what if anything would affect the policy if there were to be changes in the next 12 month during the life of the policy.
Make it easier to find or make clear the fees/charges involved in home insurance policy on the website.
As this is the first ime that I have used yourselves it is unfair to judge and comment as to whether I would recommend. As the saying goes  The proof is in the eating .  I would say that you should improve the Home page making it obvious for customers to navigate to find the page they require and also to sort out the Polic View tabs that I had most difficulty in downloading
"actually respond promptly to emails, not just send an automated response."
technical problem with the payment so had to phone the call centre where I was waiting to speak to someone for a long time.
Was waiting in a que for soooo long that by the time I had got through to an advisor I had already completed it online myself and made a cup of tea!!
You could acknowledge receipt of information you requested quicker so you can put people's minds at rest.
Confirmation via Email
"I tried calling in the evening to speak to someone about the quote I received on-line, but I spent 45 minutes on the phone & in the end gave up & just purchased the policy on-line. I do prefer speaking to someone as it is explained better. Noy entirely happy with the service with the call centre."
Be quicker with your policy number.
If you must call customers leave them a voicemail if they are unavailable and keep calling!
"I amended my address when completing the form, as it kept bringing up an alternate address which has the same post code.  It is very frustrating that the final documentation reverted back to an address which is wrong.  I have emailed (no time to call as at work) only to be told it takes 2 days.  Not very satisfactory, I'm afraid."
"I found it very difficult to locate the information asking for my reference number in order to access original quote. To renew a quote was very clearly defined butI was totally frustrated trying to find the link to enter my reference number to retrieve my quote.  The first time I tried to buy on line I was thwarted by the 'Buy Now' Link disappearing.  I then picked up the phone but, after 10 mins hung up.  It would be helpful if one could be given some idea of where one is in a queue thereby allowing a decision to be made as to whether holding on or trying later is the best option"
"got e-mail about no claims proof which i faxed , i then recieved a letter after phoning to confirm you had recieved no claimed proof, costing me money so in all i did'nt save much money takeing out insurance with you"
I have emailed customer support for an answer to a query that I could not get over when getting a quote. I have NOT received a response back as yet. Regards Ann Bennett
Your telephone staff to be customer friendly and not dismissive.
"Site didn't work correctly in google chrome, had to switch to Safari in order to remove the 'legal protection' from my quote. The site also makes it difficult to change instance details and see how that affects the premium, which I thought felt scammy. The link to retrieve a quote is tiny and easily missed, and the retrieval process didn't work. Also, you send out far too many emails."
"When I recieve a call to tell me you need proof of no claims from me, it is not impressive when it was emailed directly to you previously ... not a good start in my view."
"I am the it user, but the insurance is for my elderly relative a headed letter from you to confirm his new insurane would be great, apparently me printing it off may be illeagle, to him."
The wait time is too long when calling in. I ended up going through confused.com because I vcould not get through. Also I have my home insurance with you so was hoping for a customer discount on the car insurance.
When I phoned your contact centre I was onhold for 10 minutes before being put through to someone. I found this unsatisfactory but the consultant was very helpful and polite when I did speak to them.
"in this day and age, surely you can capture the number of years no claims on the MID. I forgot to send my proof (even though this is just a peice of paper from my last insurer) and have received a letter saying you will cancel and charge me an exorbitant cancelation fee !! For what I fail to understand. Everything was done over the internet and even my documents are electronic so how id there an admin / cancellation fee quoted for 75.  - because of this I will have to send off the paper and remain with yourselves but find the tone of the letter and the service unacceptable"
2 EMAILS SENT STILL NO RESPONSE
"I did phone to speak to an agent beore I bought the policy, but the computer system was down, agent promised to phone me back but did not! However once I bought police online had a phone call from agent to confirm all details and any questions which was very good and appreciated. Pity first guy never got back to me!"
"Very good, but it would be nice to have confirmation that i'm covered by insurance. This was not that clear. As it is still not clear whether my no claims info has been accepted."
Disappointed I had to source my proof of NCB myself. I have never had to do this for any other insurance company (15years+)
You took it upon yourselves to change my details when I phoned to correct them you upped my price. Very unhappy.
Be Honest & Helpful to the Customer
Please email me my policy & documents
Don't make it so hard to correct information via the phone. Also it would be helpful to people if you could explain why / how their insurance has gone up. It is this reason that I ended up calling for assistance rather than just renewing automatically.
Allow for people's busy lives and provide a customer service till 8 pm.
"I want a customer service that I feel want to help me, please feel free to contact me to discuss"
Please respond to my Email and web contact!
Please see my previous comment. Actually being able to take calls to rectify issues on new policies immediately to insure that there are no issues with this.
Explanation as to why my old policy went up to 22 a month (20% increase) and I can then get cover for 13 a month online.
"Your finance paperwork was going to charge me 1700 per year for insurance which was quoted at about 190.  Really bad, really sneaky."
Didn't like - I used the tescocompare website but after selecting Endsleigh the details on the Endsleigh website had changed and the price increased. It felt like a bit of a con. Secondly as a previous customer did I need to register online again to view my policy documents? When I used my old log in it said no current policies. Very tedious.
I linked to the Endsleigh site via Confused.com.  The price shown on your site was 24 higher than that quoted by you on the Confused.com website.  Not impressed.
"On following the link to renew my insurance policy, I found that the premium had increased from last year, despite none of my details changing, or having made a claim. When I visited your website and got a new quote as a new customer, I was quoted 60 cheaper than my renewal price with exactly the same cover. Whilst I was online going through the quotation process, I was telephoned by a customer service adviser to see if I wanted to go with the renewal. I told him I was unhappy with the service due to the difference in price as a new customer, and asked why this would be. His response was 'I will ensure no one else contacts you regarding this renewal', without any kind of response as to why there would be such a price difference. I am very unhappy about this and I believe that Endsleigh does not value existing customers and is only interested in bringing in new clients. Had I not searched for a new quote I would have been unaware you offer the same cover to new clients for cheaper. I have used Endsleigh for over 5 years and will not be returning when this policy runs out unless I am convinced otherwise.  Mark Bromley"
"I would recommend you to a friend BUT only via a comparison website. I ensured with you via confused.com last year for home insurance and paid approx 48 for a year's home insurance. When you contacted me with a renewal quote you asked for 60+!! Because it was so much higher I did not automatically renew through you. I again, went through confused.com and you appeared, for exactly the same deal as the renewal, for 44! I think you need to sort this out so all of your customers receive a fair price. I don't think there should be two different prices for exactly the same service. Thanks,"
"Price changes at various point in the process were not helpful. Price quoted would have been better to include tax not just as you process the payment. I didn't like the fact two optional extras where added and had to be de selected. I was quoted a price without them and I was happy with that, seemed a bit underhanded."
"I had received a quotation via comparethemarket.com for 177.85.  When I tried to purchase online at this price, the  extras  took the premium up to over 300.  Removing extras would only bring the premium down to 247.00.  I spoke to an agent on the phone she was very pleasesnt & helpful but sais 247.00 was the best price available.  I then went back to comparethemarket.com and received a quotation for 177.85, which I then accepted and paid for.  So instea dof spening five minutes purchasing at the quoted price, I spent over and hour going round in circvles before getting back to where I had started."
"Please don't automatically add extras such as personal injury cover - it just feels like you're trying to trick the customer into paying more. The options should be available, well explained and easy to add of course! Also, your renewal quotes are extortionate and it should be easier to buy using a comparison site quote whilst also linking to a current customer account."
I recieved a quote for my renewal from you but as a new customer found that it is 200 lower - interesting.
It is very misleading to transfer from a comparison site to yours with differing purchase price. On investigation your site auto fills options that were not indicated on the original specification thus increasing the premium.
My only comment would be that I found website quite confusing especially when I went from Go Compare Site to your site & the price was different as extras had been added even though I did not request these - don't this was necessary.  Igot there in the end though.
Navigating back and forth through the forms produced price increases that were not reduced on removing the options selected.  This necessitated re-starting the process to get the original base quote. quite frustrating.
Renewing my past insurance was more expensive than getting a new quote. I got a new quote.
"Found it slightly frustrating that having gone direct to your site, when I clicked to accept the insurance the price increased by 29 and I was told I had arrived at your site via Compare The Market. Whilst I had used that site I certainly did not expect to pay more for having visited them previously."
"I looked on your website and the quote was really dear. But when it was on the Money Supermarket etc I got the same as the one on your own website but really cheaper, so i took the cheaper one. I would of really liked to go on to your own website  and got the cheaper quote from you direct."
I was transferred to the Endsleigh website from Confused.com and immediately presented with a 'click here to pay now' option. I thought I would check that details had been correctly moved across from Confused.com and many details had not been. I then had to spend quite a while correcting various details and subsequently received a slightly higher quote. I found this a little frustrating and also found navigating to the various 'edit' screens rather fiddly. Otherwise I am reasonably happy with Endsleigh and have previously been a customer (a few years ago).
Fix your system so that policy transfer to a new vehicle is done at the same quoted price as is available on-line. As things stand you directly discriminate against people who do not have or use computers.
Please see above comment. I have my home insurance with Endsleigh already and when I recievd my renewal quote I went onto a comparison site and put in the same details as my current policy. I received a price for a new policy from Endsleigh that was 50 cheaper than my renewal quote. Why do you now give existing customers the same deals as new customers? You are penalising customers for their loyalty and I would not recommend you to others based on this.
You should include full price in the quote. I was originally quoted 334 but with add ons it came to 455.
"I did not sign up for promotional material but am still getting spam'd by my own insurance company. This is not acceptable. If I did somehow miss a box to be ticked it is not obvious enough. Also I have tried to log into my account am consistently told that my  policy number' is incorrect, even though it is copied and pasted form my emails - if this is due to the short period of time between purchase and checking then I should be informed of that issue."
I would like to be able to access my policies on my online account in a user friendly way. I normally have to ring up after purchasing insurance online before my policy can be put onto my online account so that I can access it. This isn't a very easy process and is pretty irritating.
"sort out your website, and the ability to obtain the policy"
"as on previouse occasions with your web site I have been unable to acces policy details on line. It why I nearly did not use you again, I now find I am finding the same problem and I am not happy."
not the best website and difficult to access my policy docs. Would prefer to have them emailed as pdf with confirmation email
"unable to get details or policy documents on completion of purchase despite following instructions,(seemed to go round in circles),unable to access my account online,had to phone to get what I wanted."
"Buying the insurance was straightforward, however since I have purchased it I have been totally unable to access any of my policy documents online as the site appears to be permenantly unable to open those pages and gives the error messge *interrupted while accessing page*. My internert is working flawlessly on every other website I try so I can only conclude that your site has technical problems which badly need fixing!"
I need help to access my documents.
had major issues trying to locate my insurance certificate as the website kept crashing
Could not access account online. Difficult to obtain policy documents online - in short a 24 carat Joke and that's putting it mildly
"The site was easy and bug free apart from three boxes which were very annoying and nearly stopped me completing the process - date of birth (why do you have to scroll through the calendar?), occupation - impossible to find what you're looking for in a drop-down box of about 500 occupations and the same for another field related to employer."
"When I tried to pay for the policy I had chosen, my card got rejected 4 times and I had to use my parents credit card to pay which cost me a fee. It transpired that the reason behind this is because certain cards do not allow transactions to your website for fraud prevention purposes, and the person I spoke to when I phoned Endsleigh was well aware of the problem, therefore a note on the website to warn that this might happen would be appreciated in future."
"I would strongly recommend that you review the section for contact details such as addresses. I currently live in Australia but was unable to put my postal address in your system,and had to use that of a relative instead. It is not unusual for people to rent out their homes while on overseas assignments, so it seems inappropriate that we cannot register our actual address with you,and to have to supply one that is in fact incorrect."
Looking for contents insurance for 87yr old mother in sheltered accommodation. Nothing exactly fits her modest needs. Must be many out there like her who don't need much cover and especially not for theft of a bike!
On the renewal page was not able to edit the level of cover to suit my needs.
"The ability to select more than 9 years no claims would be handy even if you don't use it for calculations.  Also, when buying online there should be no need for a follow up phone call to  check details  when in fact it's just an attempt to upsell."
Difficult to find the retrive quote link. Visited from cashback site but cashback hasn't tracked yet. Annoying to have to fill in graduation details each time you adjust a quote.
"Apart from the website, you were fine. Reasonable price, reasonable coverage. Of course, it is impossible to properly judge an insurance company until you need them to pay out on a claim...."
I will not renew next year as the website is pathetic.
"Make sure the information given through the website gets put on the policy documentation, not random facts."
"I tried to purchase the insurance online (after getting an online quote, the process of which was very simple and efficient)  but at the very last stage (after inserting all card details and clicking 'purchase') I received an error message. I had to then phone into your call centre to check whether I had indeed purchased insurance or not, and was then told that the payment system (both on-line and via call centre) had been down all morning (this was Friday 5th April 2013) and that my payment had also not gone through. I then had to access the quote on a difefrent day and re-do the online payment (which this time worked). I was inconvenienced by this and, as the call centre was aware of the problem you were experiencing on your web payment system, I was very disappointed to realise that you had simply decided not to advertise the issue on your site. It appears that you could have prevented customers trying to complete payment when you knew it would not go through anyway, avoid wasting their time and frustrating them unnecessarily, but you chose not too. Not very unprofessional, I'd say!"
Website was un-usable for most of the day. I finally got to pay for my insurance at 5pm after trying for 6 hours. Nearly gave up and went elsewhere
I was unable to renew my policy because of site problems. I did receive replies to my e-mails which then helped to resolve some technical prolems but still unable to renew. I had to start from the beginning and then your site refused my valid Barclaycard! I completed the purchase using another card.
"It was a shame that when I initially wanted to get insurance, your payment system was down and then I couldn't retrieve quote."
"The form to sign up was broken and missed off a section I filled in. It was also rather buggy in general. This means the policy I signed up for is invalid, which I only found after paying and getting the full policy document where it showed up the section of details I entered being lost."
when I paid the site kept running and would not finish
I found it extremely difficult to access a saved quote. I had an initial quote through a comparison site and then updated my details on your website and saved the quote however whenever I tried to retrieve the amended quote I was always back to my initial quote and had to make the amendments again!
"On the online registation  page, the postcode box was obscured by the Back button, making registration more akward than it might have been."
"Please introduce a repeat 'check' box to re-typr one's email address into. I mistyped it, and then did not receive any policy details. Annoying, and simple to prevent. Thanks."
Quote payment form doesn't seem to work on google chrome browser.  I had to use a different browser in order to pay.
Your sales person was very helpful when I called to see if my purchase had gone through.  The site took 3 times to work to take my online payment.
"When I could select other 'add-ons' for my quote, these were not clearly priced and I never actually saw a total cost of what I was paying until I received the receipt in my inbox, which ended up double the amount of the initial quote (I had then selected three add ons, which didn't specify price)."
Your website is non-functional
"I had a quote saved from earlier on in the day, and it was retrieving the quote no problem, but I accidentally typed my phone number in wrong, and every time I edited the quote, and only changed the phone number, the price kept on rising from 500 to 2000, however this was solved when I rang up and spoke to one of your agents who agreed it shouldn't have been happening. Overall, satisfied with the service though."
"On completion of the transaction, I was asked to complete a questionnaire, it asked me the price of renewal with my current insurance company, but would not allow me to enter the price. However, To give you confirmation of my NCD, I forwarded to your customer services the renewal notice I had received"
Get someone more qulaified than I to sort out your web page its dreadful
make site compatible with firefox. worked on ie only.
to keep the costs down on my next policy
keep prices low and you will get more custom
No need for contact from company after purchase to query no claims entitlement when have been insured previously by same.
Take better care of existing customers and aim to keep them by offering the best and lowest cost deals.
"sales people pretty much out for what they can get, better to look online yourself then speak to anyone on the phone"
Don't automatically add on  extras  very annoying....
"It was very, very annoying that there was no tick box to opt out of receiving emails from you and other organisations.  I shouldn't have to spend money on a phone call just to opt out of something I didn't want in the first place."
Adding legal cover before asking if I wanted it annoyed me. When you get a quote you want it to be that amount
I dont like the way we have to telephone to opt out to ensure people dont contact us selling things. It could just be on the website but you appear to be making it deliberately hard to opt out.
i found the text message saying my landlord had asked you to contact me was innapproproate as this was not the case. I also dint appreciate the sales call and nearly went elsewhere - please dont be so aggressive in your sales pitch its very off putting and will lose you custom
"Was disappointed to start receiving marketing bumpf from you within one day of starting my policy. I chose not to receive marketing information, and specifically did not include my car and other renewal dates on the original form (via quidco). However I fully expect to receive many more  offers  from you as these dates approach as I have not doubt you have access to this information anyway."
unsolicited call to elderly parents trying to sell further product.  Still awaiting response to my e.mail to you.
"I could have done without the call from the agent trying to up sell, branded as quick check to make sure all the policy details were correct. The car insured is a lease car and despite indicating this on the online form your agents didn't seem to know this was the case. Promised call back from customer services to confirm all would be OK never materialised."
It would be a lot easier if the quote you give is the actual figure for the actual insurance you ask for instead of having add ons
Please put in a tick box and not aphone number to opt out of marketing material
It wasn't helpful having all the added extras tagged on- increasing the quote I'd been given by Compare the Market by 80! It's then annoying having to de-select them. They should be something you select if you want!
Please put the actual price you pay upfront - there's so many hidden costs which makes the initial price you advertise a million miles away from the price you end up paying! That said you were better than a lot of your competition!
"annoying amount of pushing to take legal cover both online and over the phone, why do you need to say  no  more than once!"
"i would like a written policy through the post, but can't find HOW TO get this. Mrs J Nightingale Convalhome 28 Havelock Road Biggleswade Beds SG180DH I am 71 years old and like to have the paperwork so I can highlight items  DO NOT HAVE A PRINTER Not computer literate. Like the idea of a UK phone centre. Hope I never have to actually use the service but nice to talk to somebody that speaks my own language. Would be nice to answer the phones quicker though AND have a 01 or 02 number"
"The online policy booklet is a pain.  Waiting for a hard coppy ti arive via snail mail. I will be much hapier with that.  I do not know if I will get a certificate or something through the post, I certainly would like one. Bit in the dark at the moment!"
Dont tell recent graduates that you specialise in students - does not make you want to stay with Endsleigh. I shall not be renewing with this company again.
"In my case,I did not owe a car neither in the UK nor in Bulgaria.I did provide your company with a certificate from a BG insurance company,translated in English and aproved from DVLA BG,that I did not have any car accident or convictions before.U did not respected that facts for my no claim bonus.I am an UK resident for the last two years and I have been driving company cars for that period,but that did not count for my no claim bonus too. With two words,UK is a part of the EU,but FULL EU driving license and an EU insurance proove do not count by you for the no claim bonus,which made my insurance policy unrealisticly expensive."
thought I'd get an NASUWT discount but how wrong I was.
No claims bonus proof to be given withing 2 weeks of the START DATE and not the date of purchase
The phone number did not work
When I spoke you on the phone you couldn't insure me because of post code. This wasn't an issue when I insured online. Thank you for wasting my time
"Policy wording long and confusing - would prefer a concise summary.  Couldn,t find key information about tenants liability insurance in my policy wording.  Wasn't clear on website that policy/forms would never be posted to me and would just be available online."
Would have preferred to see the effect of smaller or large excess.
VERY DISAPOINTED YOU WOULD NOT GIVE US COVER AFTER REVEILING LIGHT CRACKS IN BRICK WORK. STRUCTERAL SURVEY CONFIRMED SETTLEMENT ONLY & NOT ANYTHING MORE SCRIOUS
Why ask for email address when every 1 rings me up I must have spent an hour on the phone confirming the form I filled in !!!!!
Angry about the privacy policy opt in condition - should be able to opt out on the same screen.
telephone number 0844 is expensive when calling from a mobile. I do not have a landline.
"Would be could if there was an option for short-term cover. For example In 12 months time I will probably only want around 3 further months of cover. There is no way that I will pay for another whole year. So by not offering short-term cover, even as an extension to an existing policy, surely you as a broker, and myself as a potential customer are both missing out?"
"Give an easier option for students to be insured at home adress but able to tak the care during term time to the university, very dissapointed as have taken many quotes out from yourselves trying to resolve the problem"
"It's crazy that you will no longer note a mortgage company as a registered interest on your buildings insurance. This is has been STANDARD for years and whilst various industry bodies now say this is a nice to have rather than a must have, most mortgage companies still state it as a condition - as such, if you can't provide this people can't insure with you if their mortgage company 'requests' it."
The freephone number encouraged me to take your insurance if I had known that I would be given an 0844 number on completion I would not have purchased the policy :(
"I would have appreciated it being made extremely clear that by paying monthly, I would be entering a credit agreement. I think it was very underhand the way the credit agreement was established - I was under the impression I would be paying back the policy by direct debit, DIRECTLY through Endseligh - and why wouldn't I be?   I'm not interested to hear about the small print pointing out that the monthly payment option will require signing a credit agreement - I believe IT SHOULD BE MADE EXPLICITLY CLEAR at the payment stage that paying monthly equates to consumers taking out a loan!  Although I don't plan on missing any of my monthly payments, I feel the policy was not sold honestly and I will definitely not be taking out any further policies with Endsleigh - and would encourage my friends and family to avoid your services.   I am not against the credit agreement as a payment option - and understand it offers you protection against people cancelling direct debits mid-policy etc however I feel it was not made clear this was what would happen. I believe this should be addressed so that consumers know exactly what they are signing up for.  Would be great to hear your thoughts on this. jon.foat@gmail.com"
Cannot improve.
good
"So far, everything with the level of customer service and services have been of a good standard. Very affordable policies compared to other companies too."
I've now cancelled my policy. Due to the policy not covering driving other cars (third party). Thank you for refunding without incurring a penalty.
easy enough to buy your services but fortunately not needed to see how you perform during a claim..!!
The service I received from Obie was 1st class and he listened throughout and went out of his way to help
"Buying insurance from you was very easy and trouble free.  However, the real test of an insurance company comes if you have to make a claim.  Therefore it's very difficult to rate the company or say if I'd recommend to a friend at this stage"
Follow up telephone call and customer services very helpful
"seems good, got e-mail today from you about travel insurance. I think I will buy it when it is time."
Very helpfull staff
read previous. usual service from car insurance. very poor
Annoying customers is not a good business model.
I will definitely not be using you next year. If i hadn't paid a deposit I would already have found someone else!!!!
I will not use this company ever agian
WOULD NEVER USE ENDSLEIGH AGAIN NOW.
Your policy is quite frankly a fraudulent way to obtain business I will cancel my policy as soon as possible
Great company but not the cheapest. I would go for the cheapest
stop being lying cheating thieves then
"Booked through the Confused.com website, not directly from your website.  Hence the difficulties"
TEST
Well i just bought the insurance yesterday have no experience of it
Went through topcashback.could.UK to get insurance and it has not tracked. Judging by others comments on that sites it doesn't look like it will
I have not had any opportunity to assess Endsleigh's service as yet beyond observing that they appear to offer all the cover I need at a much lower premium than my previous insurers.
"It is too early for surveys. I haven't even started interacting with you. This is what you should rate and not the web site!  From past experience when it comes to contacting an insurance company, not for claims but for bureaucratic reasons, they usually are useless and I end up getting hassled and wasting my time.  Please send another survey a month later, when everything will be settled and I will let you know.  As for your website, you can do better.  Thanks, Sterge"
Not easy to judge a policy when you don't need to claim! Will reserve judgement unless I need something. Maybe reword the survey to be 'about your purchase experience' or something. Just a thought.
None
Pick up the phone.
PO and Swinton
see my last comment
Legal & General
went thro moneysupermarket which was excellent
I have said it is not at all likely that I would recommend to others simply because I would expect others to do what I do and find the best deal for them. It is no reflection on my satisfaction with the product I have purchased for myself.
