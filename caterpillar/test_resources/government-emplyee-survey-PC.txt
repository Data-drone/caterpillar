Unit Selected: Legal Aid AgencyComments Tool (1) Having managers that actually do their job properly and efficiently, who lead and are accountable for their and their team'sactions - if managers are not suitable for the role and clearly do not have the relevant skills to mange people and who are willing tocomply with and/or have belief in the Agency's strategic objectives then they should not hold that position and those above themwho knows this should demote them (2) Flexible working hours (3) Career development (4) Actually having one to ones with yourline manager and ensuring that whoever is above your line manager is ensuring that these are carried out (5) PDR's should bedone on time, rather than your line manager entering an unagreed grade on the system then having the two way PDR at a laterdate (6) More disciplinary for those who behave inappropriately - all too often this is management and staff are left frustrated at thelack of action1) There needs to be more communication with caseworkers on changes to processes which affect them. They need to be involvedin the decision making process in order to be fully on board.2) MOJ HR desperately need some training on LSC legacy terms as they don't know what they are doing and their default positionis to advise in relation to MOJ terms. Pay related queries need to be prioritised.3) Supervisors need more structured training - yes the onus is on the individual to identify their own training needs but Managersand Senior Managers also need to focus more on coaching and succession planning.4) The sickness policy needs to be re                                                                          ed. Why do Managers have no discretion in relation to long term sick? Written warningsare not always appropriate.5) It has been said before but it still applies - we are too reactive. There needs to be more forward planning and multi killing so thatcaseworkers can work across different work streams. Also - there is a focus on driving down, 'lost time' but sometimes this justcan't be helped. Can 'lost time' be used more effectively e.g. team events/cross Office exchanges/project work.1)More emphasis on training and development.2)To discuss changes with those on the "front line", in good time and prior to those changes going ahead- we can help to figure outthe best ways in which to implement these changes in an effective way.1. Consult employees before [job title] decisions are made and carried out.2. Rather than implementing temporary change, evaluate the effects of the change in the future and only carry out if deemed to besuccessful1. Continue the recent trend towards more face to face discussion with reduced reliance on email.2. More collaborative working Despite ad hoc improvements there are many silos in the organisation, sometimes within the samedirectorate.3. Demonstrable action against those with poor attendance records.1. I would like management (at all levels) in Operational Assurance to ensure communication is a key aspect of their daily role. Ihave quite a lot of responsibility in my job, however when management get involved in decisions, they often liaise with otherdirectorates and I'm not kept in the loop and quite often I am left out of the final decision2. Management need to be supportive of employees and give credit where credit is due. The reward and recognition scheme andthe annual staff awards are great, however a thank you or message of support for the daily tasks that would otherwise gounnoticed, would be a great personal moral boost and is often forgotten about.3. Unacceptable behaviour that is brought to the attention of management should be dealt with immediately. I have worked in theLAA for years and my experience this year caused me for the first time in my life, not to want to come to work, which is terrible.This is as a result of an ongoing situation with a team member that was reported and not sufficiently dealt with                                                                          1.promotion! Been here for a very long time, i HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROMOTION OR ENCOURAGED TO GO FORWARD.WHEN I HAVE RAISED THIS AS AN ISSUE, THE WORD "BUDGET" SPRINGS TO MIND, AND YOUR PERFORMANCE ISUNFAIRLY DICTATED BY BUDGET, ALWAYS HAS BEEN ALWAYS WILL BE.2. Trust! I feel at times treated like a child, as we have to be a great team, but we in reality people go about their business, notwilling to engage or help. It still is a them and us place.3. Families: ALTHOUGH MY IMMEDIATE MANAGER IS VERY UNDERSTANDING AND PATIENT AND WILL ALWAYS HELP US,THE LONG HOURS, TARGETS ARE SET UP, ITS ALWAYS A WORRY.                                                                          A better understanding of how part time workers contribute would be useful. Opportunities for development appear to be givenpredominantly to full time workers.                                                                           A change from a culture of "entitlement" , ‘blame’ and ‘laziness’ to one of accountability, integrity and transparency that befits thetraditional ideal of the civil servant. Too many people have gotten away with too much for too long.                                                                           A clear and better way to promote that does not involved central locations in London It often feels that in order to move you have tomove to LondonMore caseworkers as it often seems like we are hamsters on a wheel.An IT system that is fit for purpose and does not require work around. CIS is simply not good enough any more, CWA is overlycomplex just to assess and still requires work to be assessed on spreadsheets before you use CWA/LAA online.Also the use of an Old Internet Explorer is surly a security risk                                                                          A clearer emphasis on standards of behaviour.I'm also bothered by the number of personal relationships between staff, and I wonder how that fits with overall values, e.g.,impartiality, especially when it's a relationship between manager and a member of their team.                                                                          A consistent approach to the services we provide and improved management of the overall workload to avoid the currentimbalance of either too much work or far too little.                                                                           A decent office to work in would be nice Something else                                                                           A fairer pay structure where people are paid in to relation skills and the job that they do rather than where the office is locatedwithin the country. The location of the office to an area where facilities are much nearer to access                                                                           A few more places for privacy. Just as I started this survey the [manager(s)] stood behind me to have a conversation with theperson next to me. What's the point of saying this is private if everyone can clearly see the information you're supplying becauseyour screen is visible to anyone passing by? Going to another desk is not an option when there are people already working incorridors as there are no desks available.Workingenvironment orfacilities                                                                          A good pay rise A greater balance between work and office social activities. No theme                                                                           A greater emphasis on actually allowing people to spend the time doing their job, rather than being distracted by large-scalereactions to a small number of negative, dissatisfied employees.                                                                           A greater focus on service and quality.Greater autonomy to manage work at a local level                                                                          A greater level of support for front line line managers                                                                           A greater sense of common purpose and collaboration between departments in place of elements of 'silo mentality'.                                                                           A little more care about communications from senior management (timing & content), although it's significantly better than it was afew years ago.

There is nothing in place on a local level ie. in the regional office. I have neverworked in a place before there is no actual person you can go to to ask even trivial questions such as pay queries, absence,pensions and personal problems etc.I believe many people will struggle on without basic support as they don't find it easy to locate an email address for a HR person inan office hundreds of miles away.HR processes orprocedures                                                                           A more friendly atmosphere from all staff and line managersAble to work without having to be stressed on targetsHave more areas for social areas during lunch time                                                                          A move away from Londoncentric development opportunities taking account of the ability of non-London staff to deliver via use ofremote working . A more flexible approach to creating development opportunities for part-time staff. A more effective tool fordetermining development rather than the reliance on the CSL programme which relies on a one size fits all approach. Moreeffective monitoring and management of workload. A pay rise equal to or greater than the year on year cost of living increases.                                                                          A move towards recognising quality over quantity, time standards for certain work are very strict and unrealistic whilst maintaining aquality service.Encouragement for staff to learn more skills and taken on greater responsibilityGreater awareness of job opportunities whether vertical or horizontal.Greater communication of changes - when our position is clarified a more efficient way of cascading change.                                                                          A pay rise Pay and benefits                                                                           a period of stability My work                                                                           A permanent deskWorkingenvironment orfacilities                                                                          A realistic resource model for our team to allow us to spend more time on learning, development and time with staff on a 1:1 basis.                                                                           A reconsideration of the Legal Aid cuts would be a good starting point although I presume that this isn't what you mean. Perhapsreconsidering the LAA's practice of taking advantage of differing levels of regional deprivation through regional pay differences(excluding London would be a good start. It's a fairly cynical thing to do (and just because it's the MOJ's policy doesn't make itright). It really is shameful. Also, seeking to redress the disadvantageous position lower grade (previously know as A1/A2) workersnow in following unforeseen changes in their contracts would be a good idea. There's plenty to go on here and you really don'thave to look hard to find things which really aren't right. It's having the commitment to change things thats sorely lacking amongstsenior managers and the exec team.Also less focus on engagement!!! I can't stress this enough. What does "engagement" actually mean anyway? It just screams 'lastsurvey lip-service buzz word'! I really don't want to be "engaged" and the next person who tries to make me is risking getting it inthe neck.                                                                          A structured training programme and operating manual to deal specifically with each job role and to therefore to achieveconsistency in decision making within and across offices, which is not evident at the moment.                                                                           A3 grade staff doing some work rather than staring at spreadsheets all day. No theme                                                                           Abandon the notion that it's beneficial for senior managers (be they at the SMT level or the Exec Team level) to spend face timewith staff in big, formal meetings. We waste far too much time preparing for such meetings and sitting through them. Ultimately,managers are focused on targets/results: if we're meeting or exceeding targets then they should leave well alone, and if we're notthen they should be meeting with team managers to discuss why and leaving it to managers to fix the problem.I don't need to be "inspired" by managers showing up to give my team a pep talk or 'get to know' me. It's wholly artificial and utterlysuperficial and (as I've already said) a waste of time for all concerned.                                                                          absence policy - recognise in some cases the doctors have stated you are not fit to work for a medical reason then a managerscares you with a possibility of a written warning and makes you feel worse. It feels like you are being picked on because you have a medical condition which can result in time off with your GP.                                                                          Accountability for decisions made.Clear progression opportunities.Pay a fairer wage for the work done and the responsibilities taken on (1% pay rise per year) I lose more than this in increased Tax,NI and Pension as I’ve surpassed the threshold between paying 4.8% and 5.6%. This doesn’t taking into account the rise in costs ofevery utility [name], food, Council Tax etc. Effectively a pay cut every year.Also with the move to MOJ traditional grades have been “squashed” together and we have a real money difference between peopledoing the same job on the same grade with as much as 6-7k difference in salary It’s now almost financially impossible to progresswithin the LAA if you are a D grade or above as you would be expected to work longer hours per week, have less A/L and take areal pay cut this is evidenced in Nottingham where it has been impossible to appoint a C grade line manager.                                                                          actually listen to the issues that affect the work we do rather than narrow mindedly following outdated and bureaucratic practicesthat have no effect on changing provider behaviour- the LAA still operates in a silo mentality despite all the spin doctoring to thecontrary                                                                          actually pay attention to feedback rather than lip service Something else                                                                           Address the issue of poor managers who do not tackle performance or customer service issues but instead get defensive and allowthe status quo to remain.Have a creche or affordable child care facilities.Invest in delivering better MI to give us the best tools to do our jobs.                                                                          Addressing practical/environmental issues would help enormously, for example the cleanliness of our office & work spaces, thelack of kitchen space available. The lack of social space on our floor prevents staff from interacting socially and unfortunately ourcleaning contractors are not very effective. A cleaner more inclusive environment would increase staff engagement and liaisonacross directorates & make the LAA a better place to work environmentally.Workingenvironment orfacilities                                                                          Adopt a flatter structureHomogenise pay across gradesAbolish bonuses allowing a fairer spread across all gradesProduce better job descriptions and re                                                                           them once a yearMove from a process based approach to a practice based approach                                                                          Albeit culturally the LAA is fantastic, the link between offices isn't always the best. More cross-office integration is needed.                                                                           Align communications streams so that we're not getting the same message from many sources. At the same time, reduceunnecessary comms that can cause a distraction from the day job and can at times feel overwhelming Communications                                                                           All senior positions in all directorates properly advertised without a 'preferred candidate' having been lined up to take the job. Thereis a place for succession planning but that can sometimes be a ruse for a personal favourite to be given an unfair advantage.                                                                           All staff to be treated equally.                                                                           Allow caseworkers more flexibility on the time it takes to perform/complete a given task i.e to move away from formal "timestandards", particularly in civil case management or at least allow more flexibility in time taken to process work. I personally findthe process affects my morale when you are judged on the "quantity" of your "daily output" of work.                                                                          allow more development opportunities between departments of the LAA and give more thought to the development and promotionopportunities for staff based outside of head office.

E.g. structurecharts with functions and responsibilities and process charts attached.                                                                          Allow people the choice to decide if they want to engage and become involved. Some people just want to come to work to work andshould be allowed to just get on with it.On site child care facilities and extended office hours.                                                                          allow the working day to be less stressful by bringing back non clocked out tea breaks and fairer hourly rates for all types of work                                                                           Amended time standards to reflect the amount of time it actually takes to do my work thoroughly. Better opportunities for careerprogression through the organisation.                                                                           An effective re                                                                           of the work carried out and the pay scales at A1 & A2. I think that the very small amount of extra responsibilityexperience just not justify the pay difference Pay and benefits                                                                           An end to the culture of permanent revolution.Less dependency on fixed term contracts - it does nothing to create a sense of permanency, belonging or security, and also meansmany good staff do not stay with the LAA.Better development/training opportunities.More pro-active and better use (and recognition) of the diverse talents within the team.Better IT systems - what is currently in place is unfit for purpose.More realistic time standards.An understanding of the effect change has on both performance and morale.Networks such as Spirit to be less London centric.                                                                          An end to the discrimination based on office location ie exploitation of the low cost staff in ST. Merely talking about equality is notacceptable!                                                                           An investment in better facilities for staff who work in or from South Tyneside - it is a remote site with only very basic facilities forstaff and very little investment since the move from Newcastle and since the significant expansion of the office.Better IT - making better use of IT generally but I expect to see changes in the Digital by Default programme.Communication - it feels there is too much information at times - it is so hard to keep on top of the constant stream of informationwe receive from day to day operational issues, local information national and strategic information performance updates, what'sgoing on across the Civil Service, Moj, LAA..... I feel sure it could be streamlined to reduce the concerns I have and hear fromother managers that they feel overwhelmed and never certain they are fully aware of what is going on. I sometimes feel this infooverload causes stress and anxiety.No theme                                                                           Annual salary increase Pay and benefits                                                                           Annual salary increases as our pay has been virtually frozen for a number of years Pay and benefits                                                                           Appreciate the difference between MI and data - some confuse one for the other and this makes the job harder.Improve remote access                                                                           As a caseworker working in an office that has been under threat of closure for a significant period it is difficulty to say. I do notunderstand why our office is closing, given the experience, QC results and performance of this office is one of the best in thecountry. Furthermore if we are due to close I am sure that the Senior Management Team (SMT) are aware when the closure is dueto take place.As such I would like to know when I have to make a decision about my future. I am sure that this is a sentiment that is echoed bymany of my colleagues, though I can't speak for them individually.I will state that I did miss the most recent executive team visit however from what I am told we are still not aware when we are dueto leave our office.Locally I feel that managers/supervisors are very good and will listen to thoughts/concerns that I have however I never hearanything from the SMT as to what is going to happen with regards to the office.Having worked under the threat of closure for several years and with the closure of the office having been put back several times Ifeel that, if the SMT know when the office is closing, they should tell us as soon as possible. At least then once we have aconfirmed date or even month then I have the time to plan/consider my future, be it transferring to a different office, looking forother opportunities within the civil service or deciding on a career outside the civil service.I feel that the SMT should provide as much information as they can to staff members whose offices are under the threat of closureand they should provide the information as soon as possible.                                                                          As a member of the Operational Assurance Analyst team I feel it is unfair that some members of the London team have to filllengthy weekly time sheets and other member of the same team carrying out the same role do not. I think a more consistentapproach is needed for members of the same team.                                                                          As has seemingly always been the case the Agency (and Legal Services Commission before it) is appallingly bad atcommunicating change. The organisation is reactive rather than proactive and decisions either take an age to make or if they aremade an age to communicate to staff. The recent situation with the temporary contracts is a case in point - management have avery clever way of telling staff everything they know but not actually telling them anything. This leaves staff, particularly those ontemporary contracts, in the dark until the very last minute. To make the Agency a better place to work work needs to be done on a)making decisions promptly and b) communicating those decisions to staff, particularly the ones impacted by the decisionOn a local level the Agency would be a better place to work if the team manager actually started managing the team instead ofleaving the management to one of the supervisors. Since my PDR I am yet to meet up with my manager for a 1-2-1 and now thePMR's are coming up and I am still in the dark as to what I am supposed to be doing to develop within my role.                                                                          As this is the only part of the survey to leave comments, I thought I would take this opportunity to give you my reasons for some ofthe answers I have givenAny references to "Manager" in this survey I have answered about my 'Line Manager', as my line manager is the one I see on aregular basis, and has an active role in my workload.Any references to "Team" I have taken as High Cost Civil as a whole, and not the team I am a part of, as there are issues withinthe office more so than the team.Below are reasons as to why I have answered some questions the way I have as the questions are too broad, and therefore will notgive an accurate answerB21) HCCT are encouraged to put forward ideas for better ways of doing things, however they do not take advantage of this, andsimple complain about it afterwards when they could have contributed.B37) This was a question about pay. I'm not satisfied with the amount I'm paid, because it seems like myself and my team areworking extremely hard, whereas there are others in the office who simply sit at their desks looking at a blank screen (this hashappened), or spending many a hour talking. These are the same people who at this present moment in time are trying to up theirpay because they believe they have not been graded properly in the MoJ. This frustrates me, as I'm probably earning half of whatothers are, and yet I am working hard and doing my job, but others dont feel the need to and are not working and not even doing afull day in the office. That is my issue with pay.B55, 56 & 57) We do this survey every year. It used to be 'if you wanted to to complete the survey', which was never the case, aswe were always pressured into doing it. The issue with this survey, as it seems with most things, is that a problem is highlighted,we all attend meetings and such to try and see if we can turn things round, then 2/3 months later we're back to square one. Nothinggets changed, and it seems all that has been achieved is wasting time. There seems to be trends round here in which something ismentioned (for example, at the moment the buzzword is "engagement" ) and we go through all this 'what it means to us' and 'howcan we...' just for a few months until it phases out, and we're onto the next thing Last year, there were some [job title] issues withinthe team, and we had meetings and groups to try and get everything back in order. Now, thats stopped, and we're back to squareone again and everyone seems to be miserable. It starts off all positive and 'we will tackle this' but then that motivation dies down.Everyone seems to think everything can be solved in 5 minutes, which clearly is not the case. If it's not a quick fix, it's not worthpursuing.E03) This was a question about bullying in which is asked 'Have you experienced bullying in the office' I originally said "yes" , butthen had to change it to "no" , as thwe question means if I had been bullied at work. I haven't. I have seen it, though and it wasbetween 2 managers. There seems to be this way that people act in the office, and the best word to use is "childish" . It's ridiculous.dont get me wrong, the situation was not handled the best of ways from anyone involved (we were moving [name] work to a slightlydifferent location). But, the attitude of people was disgusting, and a total lack of respect from some of the people was, asmentioned, childish.A lot of these comments are only in respect of a small percentage, but again, as there was nowhere else to voice my reasons Ihave used this space. Dont get me wrong, I like everyone in this office but, just the attitudes of some of them in the work place isunacceptable. I understand there is a lot going on, and that they are under pressure with pay and such, but that does not excusethem from working and just being civil to others.Thank you.                                                                          At present I think it is a great place to work so there are no significant changes I would make.                                                                           At present my team is extremely understaffed and we aren't going to get any new staff ...

Whilst things that are measured tend to get done we can spend a disproportionate amount oftime reporting on performance rather than tackling underlying issues across the business in a sustain able way.

All enquiries through this new Phoenix system are proving to be very difficult tosolve even simple things!We had a much more efficient system when we had our own HR team.Even though it was small it worked well.Everyone had theconfidence that any issues raised would be dealt with speedily & efficiently It was great having an actual person in the office withwhom you could raise any queries re : pay/holidays etc.These people were knowledgeable and understood the system well.Unfortunately, I cannot say the same of this new Phoenix system.People are not knowledgeable, can't re-solve things efficientlyThere seems to be contact by e mail that goes on & on and for me a recent simple amendment has still not been resolved.Thisconcerned a very basic amendment to personal details including Title & emergency contact details.Firstly, you would think aftermore than 20 years service the simple transition of personal details would have been correct, when we became MOJ.This is not thecase.The whole thing is very time consuming, and to end the scenario I have now discovered that I need to complete a form signedby my manager to change my Title; which by the way has never changed since I started working in the organisation. Otheramendments are still been looked into!The whole point of Phoenix I believe, was that you could update the system yourself at any time and keep track of your owndetails.This is not the case. Phoenix for me is a huge disappointment. It is not user-friendly by any means. Another example I willgive you was an enquiry relating to advice & help linked to an exterior body that we always had a connection with as employees,where we can obtain free advice on such things as health insurance/legal advice etc. When we were LSC everyone was issuedwith a card & contact number.A person came to the office each year to give a presentation on benefits available.Now no-one knowsanything about it. I was given a name of a company and told to "google" it .The whole new system for me lacks the personal care and attention to employees , making you feel completely detached anddissatisfied, with no confidence that things will be done correctly so far, it has been a very negative experience for me.                                                                          Bring back the canteen, it was good for ad-hoc meetings over lunch and staff moraleWorkingenvironment orfacilities                                                                          Budgets available for face to face training on CSL for our team.Scope to try new ways of working                                                                           By giving more job security for staff on temporary contracts/ offering permanent positions My work                                                                           By giving staff stability and security in the terms of contracts would make the LAA a better place to work                                                                           Can't think of anything at the moment                                                                           Can't think of anything, they are doing am excellent job currently                                                                           car loan scheme Pay and benefits                                                                           Career progression for employees with higher education and demonstrable ability.

I would like to see that the impact of these decisions has been fullyconsidered as well as justification to how these decisions are made.I don't feel I have any job security, I work on a project and therefore have a temporary contract for this project, when it comes closeto the end of the contract I am always told it will be extended, however, sometimes the paper work doesn't turn up until after thecontract has expired. I don't feel I have any security in my positionI feel the performance re                                                                           is too broad and the opportunities for recognition are few and far between, no matter what I do I'll getthe middle rating, so why put in the extra effort when other members of your team just coast along doing the bare minimum andgetting the same as you.The MOJ shared services got my pay wrong for two months which seriously impacted on my standard of living and all I got was anemail explaining where the confusion happened with a meek apology. There is still outstanding issue over my pay, I am supposedto me moving towards target rate however when shared services re-calculated it, it was £4k less than it currently, was. Everyone inmy team and numerous other people I know have been affected by incorrect pay. Shared services don't seem to be in any hurry tosort this out when this has a serious impact on [name] lives. What action is being taken are people being disciplined for thesecontinuous failures?                                                                          Decisions that are made need to be considered and practised before being fully implemented. My                                                                            of the Central Postal Hub,and restructuring of teams in the Agency has not been great, and also minor procedural issues are never stuck to be all offices.                                                                           Decisions that impact on caseworkers should be communicated to all staff and in a reasonable amount of time. Recent changeshave not been communicated consistently to all staff and have been delivered sometimes only days before a process changes.                                                                           Demanding targets put a strain on working here. If targets are to be so high, at least ensure that we have the resources, training,support (especially use of technology to help hit those targets.                                                                           Demonstrate understanding of how we may feel, not just ask about it and tick boxes to say that they have engaged with us.                                                                           Determine whether contracts can be extended or made permanent sooner. The team I work on still do not know and we only have5 months left to know whether to start looking for other jobs. It is difficult when we enjoy the job we do to not know whether we cancontinue it.                                                                          Develop individuals. if it is clear that someone is hardworking and capable of more, then they shouldnt be stuck in admin roles untilthe day they leave. Should capitalize on [name] potential, qualifications and previous experience by progressing and developingthose individuals.                                                                          Development Objective setting should be more rigorous within every team. I for example have not received my last PMR write upfrom May and still no idea of the objectives that we were setting due to long term sick leave. I am now facing doing a re                                                                           with noobjectives and having to work backwards based on the responsibility I took on covering her role. I have brought up variousdevelopment requirements but never allotted the time to complete any of this - including receiving feedback on Job Applications.                                                                          Difficult one to address                                                                           Dispense with micro-management.                                                                           Do not change CIS without good reason or without informing caseworkers. Even though it may soon be obsolete, we work with CISand it is annoying when changes are made to it causing workarounds which take longer. e.g if a firm has a contract but CIS doesnot recognise it, [NAME] used to be able to fix CIS but now each caseworker that comes to that account number has to do a workaroundwhich takes longer.

Make sure each caseworker has an allocation for when they come in in themorning; there are occasions when myself and colleagues have come in to no work and nobody has been around to allocate.We've had to pick up scraps of work left around until somebody has come in.                                                                          Ensure local managers are receptive to feedback;Institute effective project and programme management;Senior Managers should gain wider recognition within the Justice family for the work we do;Support career progressionReduce pointless and excessive Corporate Service bureaucracy;Drastically improve IT including network speed, outages and support.                                                                          Ensure more consistency across teams, especially when it comes to MoJ policies.Communicate with Staff about the Policies and how it affects them and what is expected of them.

Ensuring that all staff recognise that working PT hours often means strongcommitments outside of the office - not days off.                                                                          Ensure that Senior Management and Executives know which processes they are following at any given time and that they stick tothem. That they give clear, coherent and justifiable reasons for decisions made so as to enhance their credibility and engendertrust.                                                                          ensuring that expectations for all managers and supervisors are the same irrespective of the team on which they work. It is obviousthat some managers and supervisors are replied upon more than other because they are more willing and have a greater sense ofresponsibility Recognising that a healthy work life balance means that managers will feel more engaged and and better equippedfor their job.                                                                          Equal across the whole organisation, it is wrong to pay someone more money for doing a less job somewhere else in the countryother than London Pay and benefits                                                                           Equal Opportunities irrespective of race, gender and age No theme                                                                           equality regarding pay scales Pay and benefits                                                                           Even closer working between case management and contract management, this would include the CCMS teams                                                                           everyone to be treated fairly and respected by managers.Line management /managementwhere I work                                                                          Executive team visits which interacts with the teams as they work or sit in on meetings so they can understand the challenges weface in our job. I do not want to give up another afternoon hearing my own team give a presentation about the job that I do. Thewhole room is disinterested.The LAA needs to support the members of staff who have an appetite to progress and support them. Not just in the "development"department (coaching, mentoring and another futile exercises) but in having the opportunities there for them to aspire to. Perhaps amanagement programme with a job at the end? In my many years at the LSC/LAA there have been 3 jobs which have been abovemy pay grade and in the South West which I could apply for.Stop passing the buck of staff engagement onto the staff. We spend time and money engaging for the benefit of the LAA, nothing isgiven in return. Perhaps the LAA can find a budget somewhere for xmas parties or another cheap external activity so it doesn't feelso synthetic. It could come out of the transport cost where some managers often use taxis for short distances and train journeysare booked late, without railcards or advanced tickets.Finally, stop congratulating us on a job well done and show us your gratitude. I'm tired of hearing how brilliantly we've done but inthe same sentence being told there is so much more to do. There is no motivation to work any harder when we are not rewardedaccordingly. Particularly as members of staff who do not work as hard or are not as effective are left untouched. The awardsscheme is not enough. The awards generally go to members of staff in the higher bands who have more opportunity to go aboveand beyond. I am part of a remarkable team who have performed far beyond anyone's expectations, the bacon sandwich as athanks was nice but not enough (also I did not like that this came from my managers pocket)                                                                          extend temporary contracts longer!                                                                           Fairer career opportunities.

Although there is no difference in the old A2 and A3 grades under the MOJ as theyare both classed as Band D now, and the work loads and expectations are the same for the grades, there is a huge difference inpay between these 2 old grades, and yet you are both doing the exactly the same work and other commitments, even working onprojects together, and sometimes taking the lead, and o be told that you are all one grade now and this is reflected in the work loadyou receive, but it is not reflected in the pay differencial seems and feels unfairPay and benefits                                                                           Fairer time standards and greater focus on encouraging caseworkers to do their job, rather than expecting the unrealistic andmaking caseworkers feel like a failure when they inevitably don't hit their targets.                                                                           Fairer valuations of jobs - same people same grade have completely different amounts of responsibility/accountability                                                                           Fairness and equality.

This is such an important image for the LAA and first point of contact This is agreat team with very committed professional staff but overwhelmed with calls.                                                                           Faster computer systems, little things to say thank you, an hour flexible for xmas shopping for example.                                                                           Fewer pointless 'engagement groups' that do absolutely nothing but irritate the vast majority of staff who just want to come in andwork. The executive team meetings should be a more open forum, more time for questions from the staff and ensure that theexecutives are fully briefed and willing to engage with the staff.                                                                          Finance: Whilst I understand the strict target driven system of working is there for a very good reason works very well for the typeof work we process and is of benefit to the providers in terms of work turnaround and revenue, I also feel there is an unintendednegative knock-on effect to the working life of the finance caseworker who, in order to meet target, may feel unduly pressurised,creating stress and a drop in the quality of their [name] processing so to get through quantity. With so much emphasis on stayingwithin the target dates it does make the Agency as less enjoyable place to work because it removes the humanness element of theservice that we provide, shallowing the service we provide where the aim is to get through quantity, leaving quality challenged                                                                          Fixed Term Contract employees who have worked extremely hard and helped reduced backlogs, helped with the surge inapplications and transition arrangements should be rewarded with permanent contracts.                                                                           Flexibility to allow quicker business changes where there is a budgetary implication e.g where there is a need to fill a post (adminsupervisor). Improved tools for work e.g. new keyboards when letters rub off. Better and quicker local HR support for complexissues especially on sickness/attendance issues                                                                          Follow its own recruitment processes. HR processes orprocedures                                                                           Follow procedures correctly and fairly                                                                           Following the move to shared services, I do not feel that the level of HR support which managers receive is suitable.Too much management time is spent searching for relevant guidance and subsequent completing of forms. Additionally, due to theoften ambiguous nature of the HR guidance, managers can end up arguing with staff about their individual interpretations.A general improvement in the level and quality of the HR support would benefit the work environment for both managers and staff.                                                                          For caseworkers to understand how and what senior managers roles are - what is it they do? As sometimes this is difficult todetermine and establish.Managers should not openly discuss matters on the floor, too often managers are seen discussing matters at desks which isobviously private as this is always in a hushed tone - this can create an uncomfortable working environment.                                                                          For caseworkers: Less emphasis and pressure from performance being measured by hitting targets only - and instead lookingmore at quality of work produced. Rushed work from pressure to hit targets simply leads to mistakes and more work for everyoneelse and continues to give the LAA a bad name amongst providers and the general public. Also getting stats back every weekshowing your performance measured simply against a production line where unrealistic time scales are used is depressing andfrustrating.                                                                          for departments to be more interactive Something else                                                                           for less pressure to be put on people when people are genuinely off sick                                                                           For less pressure to be put on people to complete work within unreasonable time standards when there is a stringent QC process.E.g. work is allocated for the full amount of hours worked even though it s recognised that there will be an element of non-processtime.

Forcolleagues to behave professionally even when they feel they are hard done by.                                                                           For the Legal Aid Agency to be a better place to work. There has to be more understanding and tolerance of individuals differencesof the people who work for the organisation. I would like to see more black or asian employees in Executive roles as well as LineManagers in regional offices. This would go a long way to show the Legal Aid Agency rewards people who are qualified and areright for their roles.                                                                          for the local managers and the SMT to be HONEST !

This would contribute to a personal sense of not throwing goodmoney after bad.make it known that you don't need to be on a "sexy" project to have a voice within the LAA.don't see talent management as a panacea of all ills - the level of selfishness at the "be exceptional" event from those on CSTMwas shocking - lots of "it was good for me" and not much of "it was good for us"                                                                          For them to employ managers at an area office level who are adequately equipped for the job and for them to start taken correctand proper action when they employ people at both management and caseworker level who can not adequately do their job.We currently have lots of people within our office who cant do their jobs correctly and should be performance managed and not asingle one of them are being, instead we are expecting good caseworkers to correct their mistakes while we just put with it.Inclusion and fairtreatment                                                                           For there to be equal opportunity for all employees to develop and progress - these opportunities should be given to all teammembers, with the same time and opportunities afforded to gain new experience and skills if staff want them. Often in recentyears, these opportunities have been given to a select few and it can come down to whether your manager favours you or not. Ialso think clamping down on sickness/absenteeism should be a priority as unnecessary absenteeism places more pressure onother staff. I dont' think is much room for improvement on the overall benefits package at the LAA.                                                                          For very senior managers in the office (less line managers) to show a less autocratic approach to resolving issues. In manyinstances the behaviour displayed in dealing with contentious issues has seemed closer to bullying rather than managing.                                                                           From listening to ways of improving efficiency, senior managers understanding the time pressures involved; and taking this it intoaccount more when deciding.                                                                           Full explanations of why changes are being made to operating procedures before they are made                                                                           Fully investigate bully's and make them accountable for what they have done Notice and monitor counter claims.                                                                           Fundamentally, much of what caseworkers do is extremely boring and not very challenging, but there is little that can be done tochange this. There should be clearer avenues for career development within the organisation. As an agency worker within theorganisation I believe I should be more closely included in the team I work with (for example I do not have evaluation meetings inthe way other staff so).                                                                          Further investment into training and development of staff without the heavy reliance of Online Learning.

Do look at customer service or staff when considering this.eg. Out of target assessments - these were sitting in a box for months on end, as if these all were input, the targets would be low!!not very customer service!                                                                          I already think the LAA is a great place to work, but there are still a few things that are still happening and need addressing.1. The inter                                                                           process needs to more transparent so that the inter                                                                          ee has the confidence in that he or she is being treatedfairly and equally. How do we know that this is being done fairly since due to confidentiality laws we are not allowed to know whichthen opens up the process to possible fixed inter                                                                          s and sabotage of others.2. Why do certain roles need to be inter                                                                          ed and other roles staff are simply moved up into a higher position without competingagainst other staff in an inter                                                                          ? This seems so unfair A staff member could spend months and months applying for inter                                                                          sof which they have to do in their own time, then someone else just gets moved up into a higher position Feels like a big kick in theteeth.3. We still have issues where a staff member has been lucky enough to be on a project of some sort. Then someoneacknowledges this by the staff award scheme. That's fair enough, but what reward do all the other staff get for covering that staffmembers actual work that they are employed to actually do? Usually nothing rewards go out to those who have gone above andbeyond, its very rare you see anyone getting a reward for doing their day job even though they could be covering for someone whois fortunate to be doing something recognisable outside their day to day job.                                                                          I already think the LAA is a great place to work and nothing instantly springs to mind that needs changing.                                                                           I am concerned that over the years that I have worked with LSC now LAA that promotion is very limited and if your face does not fitthe management structure you will not get promoted despite you maybe undertaking managerial like role within the team you willnot be formally recognised as a manager. I would like to be recognised for the work that I do and promoted accordingly.Line management /managementwhere I work                                                                          I am very satisfied working for the LAA, and our office overall is a great place to work, except for one thing which is the paydifference between the A1 and A3 grades. This has always been an unfair pay scale and has improved slightly for A1's under theMoj, including me. I am now at the maximum for my grade, although it has taken me 20 years to achieve this, despite very goodPDR's and some exceeded grades. Although the A3 caseworkers do in most cases have more responsibility that the A1caseworkers, it does not justify the huge gap between the pay scales, ie A3's in some cases being paid £10,000 a year more thatA1's. Also the A3 caseworkers have more opportunity to develop than A1's, as they are given projects/task to do, rather than itbeen openly offered to all staff.I realise this is to do the with pay scale and not individual caseworkers, however it down to managers to give the A1 caseworkersmore opportunity to progress.There are a lot of A1 caseworkers at my office, who have been A1 grade for many years and the difference in pay, does cause a lotof friction and its something that A1's have had to put up with for a long time. However, since A3's have had a pay freeze, they areunhappy and we have to sit and listen to their complaints etc., even though we are on much less pay and have been so for a longtime. Its about time the management found a way to bring some resolution to this matter, as this would make our office an evenbetter place to work.                                                                          I believe the LAA does not take into account the number of staff on temporary contracts. I get the feeling the staff have beenforgotten and I find it hard to get engaged and encouraged by the LAA plans and future when not a lot is being done to make thetemporary staff permanent.                                                                          I believe there should be recognition for people who come to work and get the job done well. I think there is a strong preferencetowards people who are extrovert and wish to get involved in extra activities and social events rather than an emphasis on the workdone and how well it is done Unfortunately, I definitely feel there is a certain favouritism within the agency. I don't feel that everyoneis treated equally 100% of the time.                                                                          I dislike keeping a spreadsheet where I have to write my daily progress through numbers of payments, calls, e-mails etc. I believethat strict control over an employees performance causes unnecessary tension and makes staff worry more about keeping theirpercentages high than to actually focus on the job to be done Additionally filling out the spreadsheet itself is time consuming.However I do acknowledge that I have a somewhat limited awareness of what happens in the agency as a whole, especially on ahigher level and I imagine that there must be heavy pressure from higher departments to obtain figures that prove how much eachdepartment has done Therefore this comment comes merely from a personal level.Performancemanagement                                                                           I enjoy working for the Legal Aid Agency very much, however, the path for progression has been somewhat limited at times and thefuture not always made entirely clear. Having said that, at this particular point in time I am feeling somewhat more positive aboutthe future.                                                                          I feel that overall staff levels of morale are very low, this is due to the uncertainty that surrounds the future and the sweepingchanges that have been made. A little more honesty about the direction of the organisation would be greatly appreciated. Forexample, temporary staff were told that there would be no office closures, which gave them optimism for the future, but were thentold they may have to apply for a reduced amount of positions.                                                                          I feel that the LAA is a great place to work and feel that the opportunity for staff to have an input into decision making is a goodthing and this has improved over the last 12 months. I think we need to continue with all of the good work that is already happening                                                                           I feel that the LAA overall works effectively. Within certain teams there is a lack of motivation from the line manager which makes ita tense and boring environment to work in. There are clusters of people who "rule" the teams and this is taken as acceptedbehaviours. there need to be an inspiring line manager who leads the team in a positive way!                                                                          I feel that there are things that have been put in place to address this with reward and recognition and staff engagement as ibelieve these things help make your work environment a more enjoyable place to be                                                                           I feel that we should have less coffee meetings as this takes up quite alot of time. I feel my department and I do not benefit fromthese and we are losing alot of time to get outstanding work done My work                                                                           I feel that when there are [job title] changes e.g. LASPO that the training prior to the changes is not adequate. It does not giveconfidence to the Caseworkers processing the applications due to the limited training.                                                                           I feel that with the amount of fixed term contract workers that there is a great deal of uncertainty within the workforce. This canresult in negativity in teams and people not really caring about the quality of work they are undertaking. I have personally been on afixed term contract for 2 years and 11 months, have been seconded to a higher role, work efficiently and to a high standard, getinvolved with numerous projects within the office and nationwide, yet have no job security. This is extremely frustrating for me as Iwould like to make a career and have a future within the LAA but feel this is just not happeningSomething else                                                                           I find working at the LAA a great place to work anyway and I would just suggest that Communication is kept as a high priority fromall levels.                                                                           I have been working at the Legal Aid Agency under a temporary contract since April 2013 and am finding the work both interestingand challenging. I enjoy coming to work. I would love to hear about permanent positions within the Agency.                                                                           I have confidence in my manager personally and within a work setting but it seems that other managers in my office do little thatcould be classed as performance management or daily/weekly managing of their team.My manager is effective at recognising my achievements and contribution to the workplace but this seems to be as far as it goes.The louder you shout or the bigger your reputation for being awkward or a difficult member of staff, the more attention etc you seemto get. If you sit quietly and get on with your work every day and do not kick up a fuss you seem to get ignored or worse, dumpedon and expected to go above and beyond your pay grade or job description I have no problem with being given responsibility andother tasks as this provides me with variation and keeps my days interesting but I feel there needs to be greater recognition ofthose you do necessarily shout the loudest all the time.Poor performance or it seems complete lack of performance seems to be ignored by other managers in my office. They seem moreconcerned with just getting on with their casework and ignoring their responsibilities to challenge and confront unacceptablebehaviours in their team. There are a number of staff whom everyone knows do little work, frequently do do their necessary hours,claim overtime without there being any recognisable work done in the time claimed, or are just generally rude and unwilling to bequestioned about anything they do. These staff members could be named by all other colleagues and yet nothing is done toperformance manage them or challenge these behaviours.I find the environment of the office inward focused and negative. If a member of staff tries to suggest a new way of working or aslight adjustment to enable more efficient working it is met with hostility and the belief that it will not work even before it is thoughtthrough. My colleagues seem unwilling to consider ways in which their working might impact those around them and if they couldassist each other in order to make for a more harmonised office environment or workload.There seems to be a belief amongst some members of my team that they are somehow above doing certain jobs or that it is forsomeone else to deal with I find this attitude patronising and arrogant and have attempted to challenge this when I haveseen/heard it happening but think it is not something that I should be challenging and should be being picked up my managers ormore senior members of staff who generally stay as quiet as possible. Being a lower grade does not mean that you are lessimportant, intelligent or capable, but it often seems that you are treated as though you are by certain colleagues.My workload has dropped off since LASPO and I have highlighted this numerous times with my manager and my managersmanager. I have been given various smaller tasks to keep me busy and to help with the general running of the office. I am happy tocomplete these other tasks as I enjoy the variety but still feel that my potential is not being fully realised. I do offer to helpcolleagues is they seem busy but I could take on more responsibility and would like to prove my capabilityFollowing on from this, it is not that I want to leave the LAA completed but I need to progress my career within the next year andtake the next step. Currently, I am looking within the LAA, but if a opportunity does not arise I will look outside to the wider CivilService or the private sector and look to move on over the next 18 months.                                                                          I hesitated over an answer re discrimination. I have had a fantastic experience within my own department since returning frommaternity leave last year. I have suffered sex discrimination from colleagues in other departments who refuse to ever flex anythingfor the fact I work part time. Something needs to be done to ensure all staff are as positive about part time workers as my owndepartment is.Discrimination,bullying orharassment                                                                          I hope to see a better dedication by managers to strictly follow related rules and LAA policy's.                                                                           I notice that a select few people are relied upon when work needs to be done and done well. I get the feeling that senior managersshy away from pushing those that are disinterested in helping the team to achieve it's goals. I do not blame the individuals, theyhave spent a considerable amount of time doing the minimum but as workloads increase and staff numbers do not increaseconcurrently those earning Band D money should be pushed to really earn their money                                                                          I sincerely believe that the LAA is a great place to work                                                                           I sometimes feel that information vital to the success of my work and the work of my team comes too late causing us to either workat risk or to make changes which may not be as considered as we would like. We work in an environment of 'make do' and while Iunderstand sometimes we can't have all the information we need when we need it it wold be nice if this was acknowledged andallowances given                                                                          I still feel that there is a two tier LAA - those who work on an operational or regional level and those who work in head office. Frommy own personal experiences of both - there are far more opportunities to those in head office. There is also not consistencyacross pay and grade - someone managing an operational team of 10 people can be on the same grade as someone whogenerally does admin in head office - that can't be correct.                                                                          I still think that a lot of our actions and decisions are knee jerk, when we should talk through issues and find the best solutionThere is a lot of uncertainty within the LAA at the moment with regards to FTC and the future of certain sites. I understand there arecomplex issues surrounding these decisions but it is important that affected people are kept informed. We are going to be in aposition where we lose very good caseworkers as we could not offer them any assurances.I feel that over the last year or so we have done really good work on "engagement" for Bands F, E and D but feel that there is notenough work being done for Band C. We have targets/objectives being pushed down and issues from the teams being pushed up -without assistance we could get squashed!                                                                          I think it needs to continue the progress that has been made to employ/train senior managers to demonstrate core behaviours andto be inspiring leaders.Often the poor performance I observe is at more senior levels, where continued feedback seems to make little e difference.Also where an individual has an unsupported line manager, this can impact negatively on them and their performance which isupsetting, unfair and unproductive, and there seems to be little its possible to do to improve things. I'm not sure what the remedy is,but it feels like another available route could help these people improve their daily experience of doing their jobs.                                                                          I think it is a good place to work in terms of some of the pay scales across CCM but i think that to make it a great place to work,there needs to be a shift towards greater transparency around decision making when staff are impacted.                                                                           I think it is already, if not great, a very good place to work!However the Commission/Agency has changed quite dramatically over recent times and while lots of the change has been positivethere has been, in my opinion a creeping in of hard nosed pragmatism that is dangerously close to the line. By this I mean that thedesire to improve and achieve, while admirable goals, can drive behaviours in negative way a few (and I emphasise it is only a few)people adopting an “end justifies the means approach” where colleagues and employees are treated like commodities, or tools.This may be effective in the short term but is not a good way to ensure you have happy, engaged, productive and high achievingstaff in the longer term.Discrimination,bullying orharassment                                                                          I think it is going to continue to be quite difficult whilst [job title] change continues, but I hope that once strategic plans come tofruition, the work of the LAA will become more proactive and we can concentrate on core service delivery, quality and improvement.                                                                           I think its a great place to work now                                                                           I think it's already a pretty good place to work in! To improve Executive Team needs to continue to be highly visible and be seen tolisten to & hear what's being said; improvement can be made in Communications- they are not always timely especially from SeniorManagers. However, I would say that the Civil Service's values of honesty & integrity are clearly on display in the Agency- this is anenormous step forward as it generates an atmosphere of trust.                                                                          I think Senior Managers should think about the business objectives and about the Civil Service standards of behaviour. Thestatements they make are often at odds with what they actually do which does not engender confidence or trust.                                                                           I think that change needs to be managed more effectively in the organisation. Communication regarding potential change isextremely poor at the moment and the last people to find out about change are usually those who it affects most. People dontalways understand why a particular change is taking place due to poor communication and decisions appear to be made withoutconsulting with those who it will directly affect. Decisions are made by senior managers but the reasons for the decisions are notalways transparent and can leave people feeling frustrated and unappreciated. In addition, the opportunities for promotion withinthe organisation are practically non existent at present I think that opportunities for progression would help keep people motivated.                                                                          I think that the recruitment process needs changing. At the moment if you apply for a new position or promotion you are appointedbased on your performance on the day of the inter                                                                           or assessment centre yet your past performance including absence historyis not taken into account. This can result in people who may be more qualified being overlooked on the basis that someone elsemay be able to sell themselves better.                                                                          I think that there should be more focus on development at all grades and levels and opportunities for staff to develop from entrypoint grades as well as focusing on higher grades.                                                                           I think that this would be a better place to work if work allocation where based on individuals. I do not agree that each personshould be given the same amount of work/bills as some people are quicker and so people take longer. For those that take longer todo this must feel pressure and not get a change to enjoy themselves because they do not want to disappoint managers at the endof the day when the hand work back that is not completed.                                                                          I think the Agency is already a great place to work and I feel confident in raising any improvement ideas with my line manager.Line management /managementwhere I work                                                                          I think the LAA is on the right course - so more of the same i.e. listening to staff and exploring new things.                                                                           I think the Legal Aid Agency would be a better place to work if they consulted staff on decisions that would affect their job/team.There have been several occasions when decisions have been made by senior managers and changes have been brought inwhich have had a negative impact on staff and quality of service provided. This leaves staff feeling not at all engaged and like theorganisation does not care how these changes impact on staff. This could be avoided with some consultation in advance of thechanges. If what the staff suggest cannot be done it would be nice to receive a clear explanation on why not instead of just feeling'fobbed off'.                                                                          I think the number of Temp contract and the uncertainty which evolves from this is unhealthy. I think teams should be individuallyevaluated to see the different spectrum of work carried out by pay bands. The difference in workloads, work difficulty and pressuresof certain roles are not rewarded due to the generic banding of employees within the LAA. This is something that should be lookedinto to get a greater understanding of why caseworkers on certain teams feel undervalued in comparison to other teams.                                                                          I think the salary is not reflective of the work we do, and the commitment and motivation we show. I accept that this is not an easything to change and so I think if there can be no movement on salary then some additional benefits should be given i.e. more leave,more pay awards, more team away days/ nights that are funded to encourage team building. I also think despite the executiveteam claiming that we should comment where we do not agree with decisions being made higher up the reality is they do not like itandthat's why we would rather give our                                                                            anonymously.                                                                          I think the transition into agency status has left managers confused about our HR policies. This is getting better but I think wecurrently lack consistency and managers need support to get used to the MOJ approach/culture to HR issues.                                                                           I think there is a fine line when encouraging engagement. I personally don't feel engaged and find that constantly having the'engagement issue' forced on me makes me even less engaged.I think you need to look at what is actually happening in teams and improve that and then people will start to feel more engaged.                                                                          I think while the focus has shifted onto learning and development in the last month or so, it has felt that this has been overlookedwith everyone's' priorities and responsibilities and it would be good to discuss learning and development not just related to the jobbut also looking at us developing as people and members of staff outside our current roles.Learning anddevelopment                                                                           I value the exec team, and truly believe that they believe in the job they are doing But i believe its middle management in the laathat's the problem. Look at Bristol office for an example of where middle management have been sat in their jobs for years, where'sthe fresh ideas from them where's the opportunity for people on their team's to progress to a management role? A visit from theexec team always lifts spirits and makes you believe things can be achieved, ideas by team members are certainly listened to byline managers, but what can they do, they say, we only have so much power.                                                                          i wish that pepper house lease could be renewed                                                                           I work in an office that is under threat of closure and has been for several years, but the date for closure is constantly beingpostponed. However good the managers are (and they are very good in my office), the uncertainty cannot help but affect how Iand others in my office feel about whether or not the Legal Aid Agency is a great place to work.                                                                          I would change the performance ratings by adding one more performance tier between exceptional and successful Having not hada consolidated pay rise since 2009 and with no prospect of one for several years to come after the change in salary scales with themove from LSC to LAA, it would be motivating to see financial recompense and reward for all the hard work that has been doneThis would be motivational for all.                                                                          I would firstly like the attitude of the people I work with to change. The word "engagement" is used alot and high level managementseem to thing we are one big happy team. But how when people can't even say Good Morning to one another and show commoncourtesy are we supposed to "engage" with each other.I feel my team are highly under valued. We never receive any praise or recognition for the work we do.We go along to coffeemornings and the like to hear about how marvelous other teams are and as we are an under staffed team I think that these thingsare a total waste of man hours.I realise that our budget puts constraints on pay rises but over the last few years our work load has increased dramatically with nofinancial reward.So at present I feel unmotivated and unhappy at work                                                                          I would like a more definitive answer regarding the closure/merging of offices, it is currently causing a great deal of stress notknowing whether I will be employed in 6 months time. Whilst I recognise that there are a lot of changes it is making things hard towork with as I am unsure of the outcome of my job, and whilst I want to stay with the LAA it is not secure.I think the SMT need to do more of asking caseworkers on the ground before making [job title] decisions, being more pro-activerather than reactive to the situation when it goes wrong. It is frustrating for caseworkers to action out directions even when we seethat it will not work eg during the surge means assessment was minimised drastically. I also think any new trials that ome into playneed to be given a reasonable time standard allocation as it does eat into the time that we have and reflects on the stats.It would also still be nice to have more positive feedback, there is still a sense of feedback being negative rather than positive.I also think there should be a more positive attitude to using CSL as finding time to even look into what courses to take whilst stillmanaging your work load is difficult so it is usually not bothered with until compulsory due to time restraints.I also think that that we need to become more on top of the diary issue as cases which are brought to our attention can be givenharsher treatment than those left on the diary when the [JOB TITLE] flag is placed.I would also appreciate the opportunity for a clearer understanding of pay progression and pay rises, under the LSC we couldestimate our reasonable pay increase whereas under the LAA it is not the same I would also like to have more informationregarding how to achieve these.                                                                          I would like an effective HR department which understands the old legacy policies and how they should be applied and who keepsto promises and agreements which were made during transition. I dont think I will ever get it.I would also like an exec team that leaves me alone. I do not want to be called to all manner of meetings to hear about this thatand the other that doesn’t concern me. Have the meetings if you must but dont force people to attend who aren’t interested orcomplain that when they are forced to attend that they look disinterested. Let people get on with their jobs.And please please please, stop sending me emails with paragraphs which begin firstly, secondly, thirdly! Find a new template!                                                                          I would like better IT and legal training                                                                           I would like decisions to be made and stuck to. Sometimes consistency decisions are made for certain types of work and thenchanged within less than a month to something completely different which makes us look like we don't know what we are doingMusic or radios would be good as background noise makes it easier to concentrate.                                                                          I would like front-line caseworkers to work with the IT architecture team to improve the existing software applications. Without theinput of new and existing system users, developing an intuitive application system will be very challenging, and as a result,processing performance is negatively affected because of the difficulty in navigating an inefficient user interface.                                                                          I would like it to be less time standard driven. Allowed to carry out the work how you see fit rather than with check lists as this I feelmakes you reject items that you may have allowed previously as a matter of discretion.                                                                           I would like more of a balance between engagement focused activities and processing activities. I feel there is too much focus onengagement.                                                                           I would like more security when discussing temporary contracts and more communication when it comes to this.                                                                           I would like Senior Management to be more committed when making decisions: often I feel that I have no back-up when faced witha decision and it also feels that political considerations prevent management from committing to anything. This makes my workvery difficult, especially when deadlines need to be met.I would also like senior management to manage sick leave and weak performance better .                                                                          I would like senior managers to take stock,of their actions,opinions and how they have far reaching implications on other membersof staff. Be honest, open and fair with all members of staff and not just the "chosen few" who can do not wrong. It creates a verybad image.                                                                          I would like senior managers to explain clearly and concisely exactly what the above statement means to them and exactly how thisfits into the what the LAA does. It does not matter whether or not someone is "engaged" at work as long as they do their workwithin the guidelines/objectives set them. For me frankly nowhere would be a "great place to work" as I dont in fact want to work;however I have rent to pay and a family to feed so I have no choice and as places go it could be worse.                                                                          I would like staff to be consulted before changes to work practices take place.                                                                           I would like the Agency to give fixed term contractors a more clear path in terms of the stability of their job. Decisions are not madequickly enough to enable a fixed term employee organise their life and begin to search for a new position in or out of the agency. Ithink that this is unfair hence why people leave the agency to gain more stability within their lives elsewhere                                                                          I would like the LAA to be more informing to those on a fixed term contracts, and be able to inform them if they will be given apermanent contract, there is a lot of uncertainty over the future of myself and colleagues who on this type of contract.                                                                           I would like the LAA to change the whole PDR & pay re                                                                           process. The current process frustrates and irritates my colleaguesand I. Twice a year I have a PDR with my line manager. Twice a year my line manager tells me that I am "top end succeeding", yetmy last pay rise was as far back as 2010. The whole process has become a mockery and lacks meaning if there is no career path,no senior positions to aspire to and no prospect of a pay rise.                                                                          I would like the LAA to consider the skills that people have when they start within the organisation and consider this when makingdecisions about where work will be processed. I think it is a great shame that the organisation fails to utilise existing skills thatpeople have obtained from previous work i.e specifically in ST office there are a number of people that previously worked in thelegal sector as qualified solicitors/lawyers whom are now working on A1/A2 grades and previous skills are not utilised effectively. Iappreciate and understand that ECF was based in London to be closer to corporate legal, however, I still feel that this is a greatfailing when you could effectively utilise skills in ST which would be of financial benefit to the organisation in addition to providing alevel playing field across locations. Currently, it is noted that a great majority of the legal/higher graded positions are only availableoutside of ST.                                                                          I would like the LAA to re                                                                           the decision to close the Chester Office. The unknown fate of the Chester office has been going onfor over 6 years and has already negatively affected personal decisions as a result. Failing a decision to keep an office in or nearChester a defined plan with specific dates would help people to plan for their future                                                                          I would like the LAA to stop suggesting there will be redundancies in the short-medium term but then refuse to provide furtherinformation for months. Either provide honest information more timely to enable me to plan my life to include this possibleeventuality, or stop making the suggestion in the first place. It leaves me feeling insecure in my position but also unable to come toterms with the possibility of moving on.                                                                          I would like the LAA, and MoJ, to remember that:1. People are not simply "resources".2. It's only possible to achieve more for less up to a point without the quality, or the people, suffering.3. Decisions should be made taking account of all the facts and involving the right people, not as a knee jerk reaction.4. Communication of those decisions should be more frequent, targeted and relevant; it's not enough to send out an occasionalcatch-all communication, or one that simply ticks a box.                                                                          I would like the Legal Aid Agency to provide with all the opportunities (such as personal development, internal recruitment and etc)to the temporary staff.                                                                           I would like the managers to take action when people have issues with discrimination and harassment. I believe there is one rulefor some people and different rules for others. Everyone should be treated fairly and if someone does bring up an issue with theirmanager then is should be acted upon. We have an issue in this office will bad discipline and people do not get punishedaccordingly when the step out of line or cross the boundaries                                                                          I would like the pay bands to be changed. All staff across the agency should all be the same grade irrespective of the work they do.The only members of staff who should be a higher grade is the managers. There should not be that many pay bands. For example,all staff are D grades and the managers C grades.Contracting managers should be D grades because they seem to 'look down' on the staff who are in the lower bands. If all staff arethe same grade then equality would exist within the Legal Aid Agency. We certainly do not need several pay bands within theorganisation.The Legal Aid Agency will certainly be a great place to work if everybody were treated equally. At the present time fairness andequality does not exist.                                                                          I would like the senior leadership to be consistent in their approach across offices, sometimes it feels like Liverpool and Nottinghamare weighed up against each other with the weight of work and responsibility falling to Nottingham. We have to resolve most of theissues, complaints that arise and yet it feels like our                                                                           s and opinions are taken second to that of Liverpool's.                                                                          I would like the Senior managers to begin to look after the staff they have. It appears that there has been a shift from looking afterand developing good staff to a civil service conveyer belt. We have been told that if we have ambition we should move around theMOJ. The model sold to us was the CV of a senior manager, which showed 7 different jobs in 10 years. is this what we should aimfor? There is no attention for staff who are happy in their work and definitely no focus on the quality of a person's work anymore.I think that there should be a focus on quality of staff, rewarding staff that do a good job and keeping staff that have the skills andknowledge to do a job well.The rules relating to the recruitment of staff are also applied differently to different teams. We have seen a sharp intake of staff inthe corporate centre directorate for jobs that were never advertised. I am aware that some staff have been poached and moved intothe LAA within a week and jobs appear to be created on a daily basis, yet other teams within the directorate are told that they haveto provide a business case to replace existing staff - who have been poached by others. There is also a culture of 'jobs for the boys'where people move their friends into rols. One senior manager in the directorate has clearly told me that they got 3 of their friendsjobs in senior manager roles because the [senior manager(s)] listens to them. That's 3 jobs which could have been filled by staffthat have been at the LAA and have the expertise to do the job. Its definitely a case of 'its not what you know, but who you know'.Maybe this is a cultural change that came with the civil service, but it is something that no previous LSC staff are used to.Lastly, I would just like manners to be introduced to the senior managers at the LAA. None of them say hello to staff in the morningor acknowledge the existence of lower level staff. They appear to think that constantly asking for feedback means that they aregreat at staff engagement. I know very few people who would give honest and [name] feedback to a senior manager or indeed the[senior manager(s)] Has anyone actually taken him up on a offer of a cup of tea? I'd prefer him just to say hello when he walks inthe office.                                                                          I would like there to be a greater deal of support for line managers who have to deal with difficult employees.Also I have experienced issues being a female line manager dealing with some male employees, who make their difficultness morepersonal and target directly at myself.                                                                          I would like there to be a stronger communication network between area offices. A number of caseworkers that process work arenot listed on the e-mail system so, if you needed to query something with an individual caseworker in another office, you cannot tellwhich office they are in and have no way of contacting them.I would like the Agency to ensure that training does not become completely about completing online training modules - as processwork needs more that theoretical training undertaken by reading a series of Operating Procedures.I would like the Agency to ensure that contact with the HR department doesn't become completely electronic and that there will bepeople available to discuss HR matters with staff if needed.I would like the Agency to build a provision for time spent on administrative tasks into the daily caseworker work statisticsCaseworkers spend an increasing amount of time completing forms and following admin procedures required for various types ofwork, but there is no formal time allowance for admin.                                                                          I would like to be given a permanent contract to have job security. Without it people look for job security elsewhere and leave theteam.                                                                           I would like to feel trusted to deliver results based on my skills, knowledge and experience. One size does not always fit all.Please let me prioritise my workload. That way the LAA will get the most out of me. My work                                                                           I would like to see a clearer path for career progression and to feel that there are opportunities for this within civil service that areopen to those that are not able to work full time in London                                                                           I would like to see consistent line management standards implemented and adhered to.Line management /managementwhere I work                                                                          I would like to see fairer recruitment processes. I would like recruitment within my office to be handled by senior managers outsideof my office and based solely on inter                                                                           performance. It is extremely obvious to employees within my office that the recruitmentprocess is manipulated by senior management in order to appoint their own desired candidates into roles.I would also like to receive communication about changes that affect me, especially changes to HR, contracts and pay. I believethat not all changes are communicated because my manager doesn't understand what is important or doesn't take the time to readand circulate certain communication documents. Managers may need training in this respect. One of the biggest issues within theLAA is that important information does not get filtered down to employees. For example, the majority of staff in my office were notinformed of the recent pay award for staff on MoJ terms or that they still had the opportunity to opt in and receive said pay award. Ibelieve a lot of communications are lost or misinterpreted in the transfer process so it may be more effective if they were deliveredto all employees straight from the source. Then the responsibility is our own and we are only letting ourselves down by notattenuating to it.Finally, I would like to see poor performance managed effectively by line managers. Unfortunately, there are individuals within theoffice who, despite extensive training and support, cannot perform the role that is required of them. Although I am sympathetic tothis, it becomes frustrating when other competent members of the team are forced to rectify errors or take on extra work tocompensate for the poor performance of others. In most cases line managers are fully aware that members of the team cannotperform the job they are paid to do and openly discuss this with other members of the team, yet nothing is done to manage theproblem. It leaves other members of the team with feelings of pressure and resentment and does not inspire any confidence inmanagement.                                                                          I would like to see favouritism to change, ie the same people being giving opportunities time and time again, this may me due to thefact that line managers/managers are either friends with these individuals or they are pub buddies. I mean it would be nice andmostly fair for everyone to be given development opportunities. I also believe that some people need a push or assistance for themto be developed and that line managers/managers should do more to help those individuals, esp those who feel they have been atthe LAA for such a long time especially in the same role and feel they are no longer valued. I appreciate it is down to individualshowever I also believe if individuals are stuck in the same role for a long time then maybe this reflects on what their managers arelike?                                                                          i would like to see the Agency recognise, promote and give opportunities to talented individuals. I have seen more of this happenrecently then in the past but I still dont think enough is done in terms of nominating people for interesting work, encouragingsecondments and shadowing, given people opportunities to lead etc.I think there needs to be more focus on basic professional behaviours such as turning to meetings on time, responding to emails,meeting deadlines and delivering on actions. At every level of the organisation there is a lax attitude to these things which needs tobe turned around to help us work at pace and deliver effectively.I think people need more support in being line managers. They need better training and support. I think we need to identify thosewho are really good at it at all levels and encourage them to support others.                                                                          I would like to see the LAA become a more modern organisation. It is very forward thinking in some ways but there are a lot of oldprocesses that could really do with updating - paper files being piled up in offices, less electronic working than there should be, aless joined up relationship with the regions.                                                                          I would like to see the re-introduction of open days & supplier visits across all regions and for all staff not just Contracting. Raisingthe profile and reputation of the LAA is really important for us and I feel that building relationships with suppliers and giving both theopportunity to experience each others roles and how they impact on each other is vital. It will also give us both the opportunity toagree ways of working to ensure procedures for possessing work is as effective as possible.Not to lose sight of what we do well by trying to improve things we could do better. We should take the opportunity to examine whatwe do well & why to see if this can be used on other areas. we should also re                                                                           what has gone well to ensure we maintain thelevels in those areas.                                                                          i would like to some supervisors to be trained on people skills.                                                                           I would like toasters and toasties in the kitchens at Petty France.Workingenvironment orfacilities                                                                          I would like us to trust each other and realise that we are working towards the same goal. There often appears to be competitionand antagonism between some senior managers that prevents closer working at best and sets divergent working plans at worst. Ifind this frustrating because we can achieve so much if we followed the same path.                                                                          i) Pay scalesii) the whole of the pointless Exec Team who have got their heads stuck so far in the sand that they say hello to Australia.iii) the amount of middle management that say a lot that they think sounds good and then appear to do little                                                                          I'd like the LAA to be more consistent in processes. Seems a lot of regions do things differently and not all caseworkers take onresponsibilities they should (e.g. making decisions). I'd like the SMT to deliver updates in time scales staff has been promised andif there is no updates, to also make the staff aware (e.g. temp contracts).                                                                          I'd like the LAA to provide better tools and systems to address consistently poor performing staff. This is something that is simplynot dealt with with by the LAA, and often creates more work within a team.                                                                           I'd like to change the pay day back to 25th of each month.Allow and spend money for staff to have access to appropriate external training.                                                                           I'd like to think the LAA could focus on a longer term strategy. Some of the decisions made are frustrating and show them to bevery short sighted. Decisions are nearly always reactive. There's always an emergency meeting or business case needed to justifya change and/or decision when it's been clear in the past that a decision would need to be made.It's my opinion that there's been far too much change take place far too quickly. A period of stability is needed. I feel thatopportunity's are few and far between and I dont see that changing. I always considered my job at LAA to be my last but I findmyself looking for alternative employment now.The culture has changed from one that was once very much about the people whowork here to the performance of the organisation. It's not about the people, it's about hitting those KPi's and staying in the green!Facilities aren't great. Everything is done on a shoe string and to get anything done there's so many hoops to jump through to get it.When standard equipment is needed, it's often paid for from personal accounts then claimed back through expenses. This isn'tright!                                                                          I'd like us to take a step back as a team every now and then to consider what the priorities are and how we can make the most ofour resources                                                                           If all temp / new staff (those on existing temp ongoing contracts) were given an idea of job security/stability then this could helpretain staff, and perhaps improve productivity & motivation                                                                           If we had a problem with our line manager we would have no one to turn too. If we did report our line manager i.e. if we weren’thappy/problems arising then this would be very uncomfortable for all staff day in day out. There is inclusion happening within ourteam. There are also days when I could be upset and my manager would't even know. We need better links and communicationwith line managers and senior managers above our line manager i.e our line managers manager. Team building exercises/dayaway from the office and include Senior Managers (SMT) This could possibility help. At least it would build bridges for all staffacross the department.                                                                          If you are going to structure a recruitment and reward package around behaviours, then make sure that managers and senior staffactually live up to the behaviours which they glibly impose on junior staff (otherwise, the organisation just appears deeplyhypocritical).Treat people fairly when it comes to opportunity... and stop promoting people on the basis of appearance and sycophantry backedup by decidedly nebulous concepts (e.g. when you're appointing a subject matter expert, actually make sure that they knowsomething about their subject rather than focusing on whether they can talk about how marvellous they are in a team!).                                                                          I'm leaving so not really sure I can give an answer Managing change                                                                           I'm not convinced that asking staff to complete surveys as often as we seem to be asked is the best way of gauging this. Some ofthe questions are genuinely not applicable to an individual's set of circumstances, but there's no way of recording this and so theresults may not be representative of that individual's                                                                           s.                                                                          I'm not sure it will ever be "great" - but it is good, and thats good enough for me.

It could also do with dropping the culture ofoverdone positive spin and the tick-box mentality towards staff feedback, which mean that while it says it is open to challenge, itpunishes those who challenge it, or consigns them to a backwater.                                                                          It has gone back to being incredibly Londoncentric again.

The consistent agenda is cuts upon cuts and there is an underlying sense of dread thatan announcement will be made regarding significant job losses. Whilst this is somewhat inevitable it doesn't make dealing with thesituation any easier There are many positive "Engagement" programmes at the moment but these are undermined by agovernment policy that the LAA can do very little about. People want to be positive and generally they do a fantastic job for the LAAgiven the precarious job security situation.                                                                          It is already a great place to work however it would be great (but a pipe dream) if we could just slow down a bit. The pace ofchange at the LAA is significantly faster than other government departments                                                                           It is already a great place to work, just keep moving with the times Something else                                                                           It is already a great workplace however, I can see unrest amongst some employees due to the number of temporary contracts. Ican also see how this is important for the business. My work                                                                           It is clear that there is a genuine desire amongst the agency’s senior leaders to make the LAA a better place to work however, theeffectiveness of their efforts often appears hampered by middle management.On a personal level I seem to spend more of my time explaining to my line manager how things work and setting the direction thanthey do. I help them understand how they contribute to the Legal Aid Agency's objectives rather than the other way round and theirdecision making is no more than a rubber stamp of my ideas and policies.I would be less concerned about this if it wasn’t for the fact that my personal development is suffering through a lack of feedbackand effort on behalf of my manager. Questions like “I re                                                                           my learning and development needs with my manager on a regularbasis” are particularly annoying when re                                                                          s do take place because of my manager’s attitude e.g. “mid-year re                                                                          s are comingup and I’m going on leave so I’ve decided that your objectives should be the same as they were a year ago!”Given that my manager was appointed earlier this year I have to question the judgment of those further up the ladder when itcomes to identifying talent rather than ticking boxes in an inter                                                                          .Over the last few years the agency has dramatically improved the way that it communicates with us particularly in relation tochange and how it impacts upon us. That said I sometimes get the feeling that we do always get the full picture when things aren’tworking such as our progress on IDP.The new HR process leaves a lot to be desired. While we cannot expect to be treated differently to the rest of the Civil Service weseem to continually receive conflicting and incorrect messages or else hear nothing at all.It seems as if there is one rule for most of us and another for the people at the top. Our senior leaders should be expected to act inthe same way as everyone else i.e. hot desk, have fewer support staff and not bully people!                                                                          It may be a misconception, but it seems that the overwhelming majority of the organisation's focus is on staying green and notmaking financial errors, with little attention given to quality of the decisions we make on funding. The first two are important andneed to be part of the organisation's focus; however, I think the quality of our decision making needs the same focus as it is where Ithink I, and colleagues, throughout case management add most value to the work that we do, bringing about justified andreasonable costs savings to the legal aid fund.                                                                          It needs to be able to take effective and swift action against poor performers.It would be good to have big social events, even if they are not subsidised.Managers should be able to manage recruitment within their own budget and not have to get everything signed off.A reduction in roles being available in sites where their teams are based. Satellite working seems to be expensive and not work sowell.                                                                          It needs to change almost its' entire culture The management system is as follows at present the most junior line managers havealmost no power, the middle management (operations managers and their superiors) hold all the power yet have literally zeroempathy for the challenges of the job, and have almost no interest in the opinions or ideas of the regular staff, while the Exec teammake lots of noise about engagement and well-being, yet have nothing to do with the everyday process of the average staffmember and rely upon the middle management, whose sole objective appears to be to deflect criticism from themselves, foranswers about how things are doneThe middle and lower managements response to last year's survey has been one of 'lip service' to be honest. They've obviouslybeen told by [name] and the Exec team to improve engagement scores, but their method of doing this appears to be to brow-beatpeople into "feeling engaged" by constantly reminding people of what little changes have taken place. In my office, it would seemthat "engagement" means organising social events and having little chats in meeting rooms rather than giving the averagecaseworker even the tiniest bit of influence in how objectives are met.Also, as usual, poor performance is still woefully mismanaged. There's a culture of fear in place here; if an issue is reported, amanager will email an entire team about the inappropriate behaviour/incorrect processing rather than having a 5 minute chat withthe person reported. I know management cannot tell staff when someone has been spoken to, but the fact that these issues are notseeming to stop implies that the management of behaviour and performance is either inadequate or non-existentFurthermore, it would appear that the Agency's implementation of the new "PMR" process appears to be one of castigating peoplefor challenging decisions,process or management. The implication appears to be that caseworkers can either agree, say nothing orexpect a poor score on assessment of their PMR.In terms of listening to staff, again for all of the hot air blown around by management about listening, processes like the Postal Hubwere implemented whilst the most affected staff were totally ignored when their concerns were offered.                                                                          It should be like the military regarding leadership & roles. You don't allow someone into a leadership position unless they haveexperience in that role e.g. you don't recruit a pilot to do a Marine job and vice-versa. Also if work loads increase, managers shouldhave the ability to do the same work as employees and help out. No evidence of this compared to the private sector, thenmanagers would have a real understanding of time performance of each individual piece of work. If managers know what the workinvolves, then they can act on it.Leadership                                                                           It used to be a great place to work. It is now a place run by the power mad who get a kick out of micro-managing for the sake of it.Every basic freedom and good thing about working here has been stripped away in the last two years. I now dislike working heretoo much to ever imagine it as a "great place to work".                                                                          It would be a great place to work if less chasing for information from other areas of the business was required.There are some departments in the Legal Aid Agency which have internal problems which then get passed on to another memberof staff from a different department when they have to get information from them. I think targeting these departments intensivelywould reap the most benefits.I attended a CSL event where the Deputy [SENIOR MANAGER(S)] of Blackpool Council gave a talk on on what they have done toimprove their engagement scores. Like us Blackpool council has been on a journey and they still feel they have some way to go,but there engagement results are now in the high 80%All line managers were trained on coaching techniques as the audit had found that workforce were providing solutions themselvesthey were just told how to do their job. The coaching of line mangers helped install on employees that they should try and solvetheir issues rather than ask for solutions and this approach empowered the workforce , and this in turn freed up managersresources to tackle more complex problems . This had a big impact. CSL has coaching programmes which we should make moreuse ofDuring the Olympics the council decided that their employees should walk collectively further than the Olympic torch relay haddone This engaged the whole council and the progress of miles was charted on the internet . We have done events in small teamsbut I was thinking and I don't think we have ever done something as the whole LAA of this nature We could potentiallyQuoting from a colleague/ event "Going the extra mile, which they called discretionary effort, was closely related to whether or notthey thought their mangers cared about them and whether they believed their managers were open and transparent even over thedelivery of tough messages. This reinforces what we know, but we must keep asking ourselves do we do this , do we hideinformation that need not be hidden sometimes?Reward and recognition. They found that a thank you was the single biggest factor in feeling valued Managers were given threeelastic bands each day – and they could take one off each time they offered a genuine thank you to a member of staff. It reallymade difference and they say the difference is tangible . How often do you say thank you – three times a day ?"I also think that being honest about when something has not gone as well as we had hoped and lessons learnt would be good. Forexample the video about "the surge" just stated how we had great teamwork but didn't address the fact that there was bad planningand what steps we have in place for it to not happen again.I love working for the LSC and also the LAA and can see change occurring - some good and some bad. I just want to make clearthis comment is purely in relation to organisation wide recruitment. I have no problem with our departmental recruitment. I really dothink that the recruitment processes since becoming an Executive Agency need to be more transparentThere were a lot of people who moved jobs or who have entered the organisation and it is not clear where they have come fromBeing completely honest I think we also need to be really open to giving opportunities for new or interesting to members of staffalready in a department and not always hiring a consultant or a fast streamer. This hasn't happened in my department but I haveseen it occur in the organisation                                                                          It would be a lot better if changes to Legislation were dealt with in an appropriate and timely manner with information flowing tocaseworkers to enable them to make decisions. I refer to the introduction of LASPO. The training consisted of 1 hour for non familyand a further 1 hour for non family work and yet the engagement presentation by [name] went on for 3 hours!!This means that we are constantly referring to the Act and making our own conclusions as to what it means which isn't good forconsistency. The frequently asked questions booklet is a useful tool but again this has not been updated yet. Caseworkers areprobably asking the same questions to the various groups and could even be getting a different answer At the moment we arewaiting for a definitive decision in relation to the CFA question but what do we do in the meantime?Motivation could be raised by allowing all sites to close at 4pm on Xmas Eve and New Years Eve. This would not cost the Agencyany money as time would be the employees own time used and electric could be saved with equipment being switched off. Overthe last years we the employees have given given and given and received very little in return. Help to raise morale a little by thissmall gesture.My line Manager does not really have time to take notice of my performance and issues as she is so too busy dealing with Statsand e mails and is constantly having to deal with these as a priority. I completed my PDR on time and sent it on but have so far notreceived it back. (this relates to last year) It makes me question is there any value in spending my time in preparing for this andwriting up notes after the event.Daily team briefs are getting out of control. It was so much more interesting when we had them on a weekly basis.I recently returned (17-09-13) from annual leave to find my computer not working and rang ATOS who told me my account hadbeen closed but due to technical problems they were not able to resolve the problem for me. I managed to sort something out forthe morning but rang back at lunch time to query the position and explained what I had been told and was informed that they do notclose accounts and when he checked my computer was unlocked and ready to use. A call from ATOS informing me of this wouldhave meant I could have got on with some real work.More recently the font size on my CIS screens has been reduced when creating cert numbers or file tag number when I queried thiswith them I was told they were not able to do anything as it appeared to be due to a CIS fix. Please when they are applying thesefixes can they be aware of the impact it has on users of the system.                                                                          It would be a significantly better place to work if the attitude of case management caseworkers is to be happy to take work on,rather than being scared of the unknown due to a fear of being QC'd. The fear of decision making impinges our effectiveness andcross-office communication and relationships.                                                                          It would be better if everyone was treated the same as some members of the team are treated in accordance to their personalityand allowances are made for people who are on good terms with senior case workers.It would be better if there were less fixed term contracts as I do not feel fully secure in my role at the LAA and very little is said toaddress this and inform me of whether my fixed term contract is likely to be renewed.I also feel a better rate of pay would make the LAA a better place to work.                                                                          It would be nice to see greater integration across the organisations by allowing staff to shadow other departments. Currentlydifferent parts of the organisation are very isolated from each other and have little idea of who does what                                                                           It would have to change an awful amount to make it a great place to work. staff are underpaid, with even other managersrecognising that staff are multi tasking in areas such as forensic accounting fraud detection yet get paid the equivalent of asupermarket worker. The general atmosphere in the office is one of doom and unhappiness                                                                          It's not really clear what it means to be a Civil Servant or the wider MoJ family, there still seems to be an air of us and them, thismust be holding some people back from truly making the most of what is on offer and excelling.                                                                           It's ok as it is.                                                                           Job evaluation for grading throughout LAA and not just localised.                                                                           Job security , better wages                                                                           Job security ,we do not have the job security we had previously                                                                           Job security is my biggest concern which is not something that I believe can be addressed Something else                                                                           Job security would be a real plus. It would help if praise could just be praise, rather than 'you've done ever so well, but there's a lotmore to do yet. It gives an impression of whatever we do is just not good enough.                                                                           JOB SECURITYHONESTY RE DECISIONS RE REDUNDANCYMORE CHANCES OF PROMOTION & DEVELOPMENTSALARY INCREASES                                                                          Jobs advertised more openly. When recruitment is taking place within a directorate staff should be informed and introduced to oneanother. More focus on staff development and not just KPIs. More desk space to allow for flexible working                                                                           Just being left to get on with your job.

I'm aware thatnothing can be decided until more is known, but the constant "we dont know yet and we'll tell you when we know" comments donthelp - I'd like to be told more about what's being done to make the decisions, be given an exact deadline of when we'll know by(and have the deadline kept to!), and updated as and when anything changes or happens that could influence the decision Iunderstand it's a difficult decision to make, but there are people's lives and it's not right to keep people hanging on for news - in afew months, a lot of people could be out of a job, and the impact this has on people needs to be considered more. We'reindividuals, not just numbers on a contract.Furthermore, I'd like more consideration to be given to those with health problems. I know that absence due to sickness needs tobe controlled and kept to a minimum, but I feel that the current policy of dishing out written warnings after (in my opinion not a greatdeal of absences is unfair and promotes people coming in to work even when they're unwell - which results in them not recoveringor taking care of themselves enough, and other people becoming sick in turn. I feel the written warnings policy can be seen as asubtle threat to employees, rather than a fair way of managing absence. It's all very well and good having an appeal process, butemployees with health problems shouldn't have this stress at work in the first place - rather than taking the number of absences onpaper, it should be considered more on an individual basis. There are always reasons, and those with health problems are oftendiscriminated against, I feel, with this policy.                                                                          Keep going the way it is, implement the suggestions.                                                                           Keep heading in the same direction particularly getting more staff involved in [job title] decisions/ change processes                                                                           Keep up the R&R process.                                                                           LAA is a good place to work and the fairness and how one is treated I have never experienced previously in the private sector.Very satisfied.                                                                           LAA should have a formal way of recognising contributions of individuals who performs exceptionally in their day to day work                                                                           LAA should mandate all future and current line managers to undertake interpersonal skills' related courses. Also, communication isvery important with the appropriate tone and pitch. And importantly, all managers need to know that every employee mattersregardless of their status. Respect and love are reciprocal. So, every employee deserve love and respect. Every employeedeserves te right to peace of mind to do their work.Something else                                                                           Lead from the top - Senior managers to say hello to all staff. To take pride in their staff by saying thanks and knowing people'snames.                                                                           Learn lessons from current IDP project and this time, put them into practice in the next project.                                                                           Less bureaucracy - simple things such as recording annual leave involve updating a diary, two spreadsheets and a paper record.Greater empowerment of middle managers (Band As) - can often feel that they dont have sufficient confidence or ability to make adecision or that they feel restricted by Senior Managers.Greater confidence in working from home - it seems that there are mixed messages between departments and managers regardinghow often it should be used what criteria (if any) have to be met.                                                                          LESS CHIPS, MORE FISH.                                                                           less constant focus on targets, more flexibility on performance management when offices are green.

Too many irrelevant E-mails are received on a daily basis. Senior management make decisions/changes which havean impact on caseworkers however caseworkers are not consulted.                                                                           Less emphasis on time standards and statistics which put pressure on caseworkers, which can cause errors, and which can makecaseworkers feel entrusted, and make they themselves feel like statistics                                                                           Less exec team meetings.

Abolishthe need to always advertise a job through the fair and open competition rule.

Also look again at time scaleson processing casework- mistakes are made because not enough time is given to process properly                                                                          Listen to caseworkers who have ideas to improve work processing and team morale.                                                                           listen to comments negative and positive and receive them exactly the same way.                                                                           Listen to employees                                                                           s on their take on work rather than the chosen few.                                                                           Listen to its staff, and then take action upon that.Be more open and transparentStand by decisions.Have someone accountable for decisions.Remove the blame culture that has grown over the past few years.                                                                          Listen to people .Allow people to honestly speak about how they feel without being made to feel negative.Dont expect people to beover engaged by having to participate in fun and games on.Sometimes trying to hard to make things too nice can be patronisingand create false picture.Mature people may not want to feel like they are working in a immature environment.If people are of alower grade and content at that level then make sure they are not stressed by having to deal or be put on by dealing with workabove their ability especially when higher grade staff should be dealing with it. Make sure managers challenge inappropriatebehaviour.                                                                          Listen to staff when they say they cannot squeeze any more time out of the current time standards and they should be re                                                                          edASAP                                                                           Listen when concerns are raised about the way we do or plan to do things and not dismiss it out of hand and criticise the individualas being negative, especially when they put forward alternative solutions, then several months subsequently when others raise thesame issues implement those solutions causing delay and inconvenience.                                                                          location back to town centre instead of out in a particular bad rough areaWorkingenvironment orfacilities                                                                          Long Coffee Mornings and meetings, Constant E-Mails that are far too long to read and do not always apply to the department weare working in, to many forms to fill in overall a lot of time is spent doing these things and not enough time spent working supplymore desks, need resource to do work effectively ie more staff,                                                                          Longer opening hours, more opportunities to leave early.                                                                           Lose the obsession with statistics Tell the truth at all times.

I thought a caseworker would take workload of a certainarea of work and develop relationship as I have done in the past. This is well paid data inputting and stupefying. I am glad to havea job in the current climate and push myself hard to achieve and deliver but enjoy nothing about my work. I gain no job satisfactionPeople outside work have noticed the difference in my personality since working here.                                                                          Making people have permanent contracts                                                                           Making sure all teams in the LAA embrace a culture of continuous improvement rather than hold on to old values & ways of doingthings that doesn't chime with this                                                                           Manage change better - we have no visibility of the change management teams and processes (central design authority,programme and project managers, etc.) and it often feels that in Case Management we're the last to be told about the changes toour working processes and procedures.Managing change                                                                           Manage change better.                                                                           Manage change better: my feedback on this issue is still informed by the way in which the Chester office move has been handled(ie badly. I also think that there was not adequate preparation my management for the LAR surge.I often find that senior management (NOT my line manager), especially the [manager(s)] at my office, is too bust to deal with issueswhich I raise. I can be very hard to have a face to face discussion when you want to talk about a pressing issue. The pace at whichdecisions are made by senior management is slow and can be frustrating. As an example, there have been various ideas forimprovement to the way we work in relation of a pilot project I am involved in. I find that when suggestions for improvement are putforward it can take months for any decision to be made and even longer before it is put into place. This does not encourage me toput forward new ideas and attempt to solve problems.I "see" my [manager(s)] frequently but I do think that person is accessible as they should be. iI realise they have many demandsupon their time but if some time each week/fortnight was put aside for face to face talks then this would be good. All to often emailsgo unanswered or things are put on the back-burner and never brought up againThe communication of new guidance needs to improve Decisions are made but are often not communicated well across all teamsin all sites. I find ccbig a great resource but I am concerned that decisions are not being communicated as effectively as they couldbe                                                                          Manage out poor performance so it stops other people doing more work to make sure the work is done                                                                           Manage people better - a lot of people falling out and arguing and nothing is done about it. It makes it a difficult place to be.                                                                           Manage poor performance effectivelyEnsure HR policies and procedures are applied consistently regardless of location and teamBring back and enforce core hours i.e. everyone must be in between 10-4                                                                          Management to be more transparent Staffing levels to be maintained so that there is room to be able to implement policies such aspart-time working and career breaks.                                                                           Managers and supervisors take the role to actually manage their teams proactively. Not just show up and whinge on about howthey need to complete great number of work, which puts people off from engaging with them. I strongly believe that manager andsupervisor should engage with team members having one on one meeting. Where they can talk about: what they are happy withwhat they might need help with is their training they would like to part take in.Not just say on a team meeting “oh there is training out there, for look for yourself.” This type of comment annoy the [*@:!] out ofme, because if you dont do your work your not efficient enough. You get harassed over efficiency need to be above a certainamount, this makes you feel as you dont have time to look into training. These one to ones should be regular eg every 2 weeks notevery 6 months. If you do this regularly you can maintain and track your progressionEncouragement, there is not enough of encouragement within teams. If you're a manager or supervisor, it is your duties to lead theteam. Encourage everyone give a motivational speech if it needs be. If idea neither good nor bad is given let us know why this ideais not going to be implemented. At least then you can look back and evaluate this. You never know this fail now could lead tofurther success in the future.Just be more positive!!!                                                                          Managers and supervisors to be more hands-on with the team. Whilst I appreciate Team Managers have difficult roles (havingbeen one myself) I believe more engagement with their teams, for example a quick informal chat with team members first thing of amorning, would go a long way to not only breaking down some of the "unapproachable" attitude team members feel but also theirvisibility and shows they're taking an interest.There are too many "groups" and "champions" which is beginning to muddy the water and, I believe, remove some of theresponsibility of managing a team from Team Managers and Supervisors to team members. Although this can have benefits forteam members such as personal development, I also feel that many of the issues raised by team members for example to EqualityStreet are issues/concerns that perhaps shouldn't have got that far.With the number of groups and champions I feel this is not helping with a consistent message, with some groups overlapping onresponsibilities, etc. It sometimes feels that while there are people who have additional responsibilities (such as being a champion,etc) nobody actually TAKES responsibility even though I have no doubt that those people involved have the best of intention.It sometimes comes across that although the company recognises there are issues, the people with the responsibility and means tomake an impact are not necessarily those that do so and are happy for others to do the work on their behalf.I would suggest streamlining reducing the number of groups/champions.I welcome the new PMR system being introduced as it's a similar system to what I have been used to in previous employment.There has been very little (or no) consideration for behaviours to date and there has tended to be an attitude of 'we don't care howyou reach your targets as long as you do'. I also hope with PMRs that there will also be clearer and more defined objectives set.                                                                          managers need to be vetted more to ensure they are all at the required standard. More PMR moderation to be done                                                                           Managers to have a better understanding and knowledge of the work undertaken as well as managing the teamLine management /managementwhere I work                                                                          Managers who recognise hard work and reward the same rather than let poor performers off with very little work and pass the moredifficult and complex work to people who they know are competent. Maybe if I was more rubbish at my job I would get less workand get left alone to do my allocation rather than get additional complex work because the managers cannot approach other staffmy level as they are "poor performers"!                                                                          Many national projects/developments still have a main base in London which prevents some candidates from applying for roles. Ifwe could do more to locate projects/developments around the LAA regional offices this would open the opportunities up further.                                                                           Modern IT! our PC's, Laptops, blackberries and IT software are tragically out of date. Better pay! Private sector companies start myrole at nearly double what I'm paid. I dont expect to match that but it would be nice to be a little bit closer!

There is often very little consideration for how such decisions will affectcaseworkers jobs and decisions that are then made to reduce problems are reactive and often not effective. If caseworkers hadbeen consulted initially they could have advise on potential issues and sufficient action could have been taken prior to the change.                                                                          more consultation with staff before changes are brought in, especially with those caseworkers who will have to deal with thechanges e.g Check-lists. More consistency between the offices.

The Legal Aid Agency has mentioned the 5 day development planfor every member of staff, however I do not know any body who has been shadowed or mentored as I believe there is not enoughencouragement and support for this. Line managers should help out more in this area and at least point in a direction to help out.                                                                          more equality within colleagues not always the same people being asked to do something                                                                           More face to face training - not solely dependent on on-line packages. For that training to be delivered comprehensively and in time                                                                           More flexibility in allowing compassionate leave Pay and benefits                                                                           More flexible working during the weekends, to offset hours during the working week (Mon - Fri).                                                                           More focus on developing first class line managers as this is one area I feel is lacking within the LAA. Possibly even set trainingcourses for anyone with line management responsibility                                                                           More focus on rewarding those that do a great job and to not get lost in the internal politics                                                                           more focus on team building Team working                                                                           More forward planning. At times workload is not spread evenly with several [job title] priorities all coming to a head at the sametime i.e. Civil [name] rejects; IDP transformation Legal Aid Transformation More thought needs to be given as to how we canmange the timing of such initiatives better.                                                                          More high level opportunities outside London The world is getting smaller yet the civil service is too London-centric                                                                           More honesty and integrity shown by my line manager when putting forward ideas for change or asking for personal training anddevelopment. So far in my current role, I get the feeling that no matter how hard I work or how many training needs I address tocarry out my job effectively, the training I require has yet to be provided. My ideas to facilitate change for the better is very rarelyfed back whether positive or negative.                                                                          more input into working practices and confidence that we will be listened to and acted upon                                                                           More interaction with other departments                                                                           More internal & external training opportunities, greater communication between teams                                                                           More involvement from front line staff in planning stages of projects / systems rather than at the end when systems designed.Ensure relevant SLT members attend local offices                                                                           more job certainty                                                                           More job opportunities to progress to a higher grade in the field we work in, rather than having to change to a different type of jobcompletely to get promoted. E.g. Finance team not moving onto the phone team to be promoted, to be promoted within the Financeteam                                                                          More joined up thinking with MoJ (eg much info we need is on the MoJ intranet, but not linked to or mentioned on the LAA onewhich we use every day).                                                                           More joined up working in the MOJ                                                                           More large lockers provided in Petty France to allow cycling and running to work.Workingenvironment orfacilities                                                                          more money Pay and benefits                                                                           More open and transparent recruitment procedures being carried out by a central recruitment team, instead of a localisedrecruitment procedure. More recognition for a job well done More social sporting events, funding for sporting teams.                                                                           More opportunities for career progression in regions - IT seems that many posts are restricted to London Given the opportunitiesand facilities that exist for remote working surely it is not necessary for this to continueLearning anddevelopment                                                                           More opportunities for development other than in London A lot of schemes which are introduced either in the main or solely focuson the London Region Therefore, people in other places are already automatically disadvantaged when applying as they will needto travel long distance (and foot the [name]) for inter                                                                          s and the actual placement will involve travel as well.                                                                          More opportunities for real promotion with consistent short-listing and selection process. Too many opportunities are offered withone week to apply or 10 days. This leaves part-time workers at a disadvantage, and leaves processors at a disadvantage becauseit's hard to take time out from processing to work on your application or meet with a manger for guidance. I'm not even clear ifapplications for different positions should be done at work or in your own time. It would also help if the job descriptions were writtenmore in layman's terms or at least avoid huge amounts of jargon and acronyms, because some of them are impenetrable if youdon't already work within the specific department.Learning anddevelopment                                                                           More opportunities for staff to become involved in project work, i.e. advertise when projects are available so staff can apply ratherthan specific individuals being chosen as they sit close to managers or have been involved in previous project work.                                                                           More opportunities of progression and learning. Although there might not always be opportunity to move up bands due to thecurrent situation of temps etc, I know some of us would still like the chance to be involved in higher roles in order to enhance CV'sand have a wider understanding of the processes.                                                                          More opportunities to progress                                                                           more opportunities to spend one to one time with individuals across my remit - can see the benefits immediately when i can do thisand it results in both improved engagement and great suggestions from individuals as to how to make things better Leadership                                                                           More opportunities to use skills you already have and have further training, for example in Information Technology andmanagement, especially for those on fixed term contracts as this would make them a more viable prospective employeeAlso stop using words incorrectly, for example 'to cascade a leaflet' or 'Saturated by surveys'                                                                          More opportunity for caseworkers to learn new skills and exploit existing skills Learning anddevelopment                                                                           More opportunity for promotions without having to move teams in order to get a promotion.

Managing change                                                                           More positive environment and put a less threatening sickness absence policy in place.                                                                           More practical planning rather than inspirational planning i.e. IDP - we have known for some time the system was not ready and fitfor purpose but have not looked at the impacts and implications of delay.                                                                           More promotional opportunities in the regions and not just London based. Although we are told we can apply for these, somemembers of staff cannot commit to that level of travel each week.                                                                           More realistic time scales for developing projects                                                                           More recognition for case management. Senior management appear to believe the case working team do a straightforwardprocessing job when there is a lot more to the role than just inputting things onto a computer. The job often requires extremelycomplex work which we are expected to do but which is not recognised, and there are many skilled caseworkers who feel that theirknowledge and hard work is not sufficiently understood. Other teams within the organisation also look down on case managementwithout good reason and make caseworkers feel belittled.                                                                          More recognition for knowledge of processes and correct decision making in line with Contracts and guidance in regards toadvancing in career. Currently the 'personal skills' take president over actual capability to make correct decisions on workundertaken.                                                                          More recognition for the work you do and to be valued more.                                                                           More recognition that staff who are not doing the "sexy" or "high visibility" jobs still make a significant contribution that enableothers to have the time to do those "sexy" or "high visibility" jobs .

Also unfreeze pay for those who have notjoined the MOJ. Use redeployment of staff less by not using short term workers so much.                                                                           More regular performance re                                                                          s.

I know this is as a result ofprevious feedback about not communicating enough but it has to be meaningful communication rather than a scatter gunapproach. if I read every article, e-mail and newsletter thats sent to me I would't have time to do my day job. A good example is theCM Newsletter. This is really useful as long as the articles aren't then re-hashed and sent again in e-mail form.                                                                          more structured and better training to give people more confidence and a better grounding to do the specific roles                                                                           More Support for Line Managers with large teams.                                                                           More support for managers. Civil service/MoJ devolve multiple activities (for example recruitment) back to individual managers, butwe need more resources to deliver these additional activities.                                                                           More team building exercises.

WE GET WEEKLY EMAILS FROM THE [SENIOR MANAGER(S)] WHICH AREENCOURAGING BUT THIS SHOULD CONTINUE DOWN THE LINE OF MANAGEMENT                                                                           Move away from blame culture and back to resolving matters as a team                                                                           Move away from the obsession with targets and time standards. Managers must be aware that some pieces of work take the timethat they take and cannot all be quantified in the same way. The fact that many senior manager make reference to pieces of workthat do have more 'favourable time standards' speaks volumes to staff who deal with different allocations. I feel very strongly thatmy contribution is only valued if I do half a job, not if I take time to complete something fully. It does appear that the lowest gradecaseworkers are the most heavily monitored staff in respect of time & quality, and I fear concerns that question this principle areignored as they are not want senior managers want to hear. A climate of fear if you fail to achieve time standards because offactors you cannot control is never going to be a good thing for a staff morale or quality of work.Opportunities to undertake further training ect. are severely limited due to this for many. I think many of the recent improvements( electronic hand book /rates calculator) have had significant input from caseworkers. All organisations need knowledgeable staffwho are happy to more or less remain in the background, doing the job to the best of their abilities and being as productive as theycan. It appears the latest competencies and objectives require a more 'front facing approach' which will never sit comfortably witheveryone. A more inclusive approach whereby staff who just get on with the day to day job are valued in the same way as thosewho wish to climb through the ranks would be nice.                                                                          My Blackberry - please replace it with a modern gadget that supports flexible working and is actually enjoyable to use.

Management seems to be a bit complacent about thisand should organise a blitz on the work rather than have lots of meetings, which do nothing to help alleviate the backlogs (quite thereverse).                                                                          My wage continues to decrease year on year due to inflation being very much higher than our pay awards.

I would also like to see support groups more widely advertised as many people are not aware of thingslike the LGBT networks etc. I also feel this would be a good way to advertise the LAA as a great place to work as we could berecognised by companies like Stonewall. Separate to this I would also like to see the HR/pay process changed as I have had threedifferent incidents in the 7 months here which they have struggled to resolve and left me out of pocket.                                                                          Obsession with targets/ figures , absolutely no appreciation of a job being done well but done within target .Ankle snapping atcaseworkers "how many do you predict you will do today", when you have no way of knowing                                                                           OFFER A PERMANENT JOB RATHER THAN A JOB BASED ON CONTRACT SO THAT PEOPLE CAN MAKE PLANS FORTHEIR FUTURE AND THE FUTURE OF THEIR FAMILIES                                                                           office location                                                                           On a personal level I work for an office that is due to close yet we are regarded as one of the better performing offices who areleading on the reject fix project. This seems nonsensical and I feel is effecting moral as more and more staff leave when in someaspects they do not want. This office should not be closing and it is difficult to understand why we are being closed down andexceptional skilled staff made to choose. To me the only thing that would make this a better place to work is to keep this office open                                                                          Once CCMS comes in (if it works) I would like to able to work remotely on occasions where it suits - at a "work hub" e.g. at courtbuildings or other hot desk locations - all you really need is an internet connection. [NAME]'s commitment to this at Civil ServiceLive has never been mentioned in the LAA but we're actually in great position to be able to make thing more flexible.                                                                          One point would be to revamp the Reject checklists and remove the three reasons and back it goes idea.

Managers being made to account for decisions they make and also employees having theopportunity to feed into managers PDR's e.g. 360 degrees feedback.                                                                           Out with the old and in with the new, one of the many problems within the LAA is that people in middle management have been inthe LAA/LSC for many, many years and have not moved with the times, they have outdated                                                                           s and are resistant to change.Most Managers need to go on more training course to improve their skills with dealing with change and people, managers need tounderstand they are there to support their staff, not the other way around.                                                                          Over the last year the Legal Aid Agency has done an excellent job of communicating difficult changes and difficult messages tostaff. The Executive Team are very approachable and encourage staff to speak / email them if they have ideas and concerns. Ilike the way this is done through various communication mechanisms. This is what contributes to making the LAA a great place towork. Please continue to do this, don't reduce these communications.                                                                          Overall, I think that the Legal Aid Agency is a fantastic place to work. The head of my team is very passionate and enthusiasticabout the work of the team and encourages me to learn and develop. I am very lucky to have the pleasure of working with themand I am grateful for the experience I have gained with the LAA. I would like there to be more certainty in decisions affecting myfuture and the future of my team (I am on a fixed term contract but I would love to stay on for as long as possible - maybe even ona permanent basis).                                                                          Overly I do enjoy the work I do, I have gained alot of interpersonal skills and have learnt new skills, this is been out of my jobdescription I have worked on projects to assist senior managers, to help them with weekly statistics, however I do not always feelthis is valued. I like the flexi system which enables me to manager my private life and work life, which is very beneficial. I dohowever feel some managers dont deal with caseworker queries straight away and seem to give their concerns less importance.Overly I do feel this job is good stepping stone for exposure to working life, however I would not aspire to stay on a permanentbasis. I feel there is no progression and recognition is not given to the ones who deserve it the most.                                                                          overtime rates for part time staff Pay and benefits                                                                           pay increase Pay and benefits                                                                           pay re                                                                          s in all locations.

It is always a case of 'give them another chance' or 'carry out another report'.This is especially rich given that the HR help desk is one of the things that (along with the ATOS help desk) also needs to begreatly improved Help is not something that is easily found when using either of these services.The engagement or 'making work a better place' stuff needs to calm down now - it feels as if it is being stuffed down my throat and Idont see that it is helping as it is always the same people that take part or contribute. There are some people that never do, andthose are the people that needed more engagement in the first place.The D&G processes and time scales need to be re                                                                          ed.

While this may be workable for teams wheremembers are regularly out of the office, where the team is office based this just causes problems and means that people wastetime hunting for a desk to use.Removing open plan working - Open plan working is also disruptive and makes it hard to concentrate when there is excessiveamounts of noise. While it is sometimes useful when needing to speak to people from other teams it is more often problematicbecause of the noise levels. It is also unpleasant when members of staff are inappropriately spoken to by senior managers not onlyin front of their own team but in front of other teams as a result of the open plan environment. While I have not been on thereceiving end of such treatment I have witnessed it and this in itself is uncomfortable and makes me want to leave the LAA as I donot want to be subjected to this.                                                                          Providing the right tools for the job that we do, not just what suits the management.

Once again the LAA appears to becoming verysenior manager heavy. Reduce the number of meetings and relax the stress on "engagement" - we get it. Let us get on with ourjobs without having to get excited about endless "engagement" exercises (most of them for some reason involving cake).                                                                          recognise that my grade is not on the same level and the general MOJ level D's.

This has also meant that the LAA seems to have gone back to the "silo" working mentality that we had worked toeradicate, which leads to no-one taking responsibility for managing work.                                                                          Remove the differences in the MOJ policies.

I feel managersshould be strong visible leaders who you aspire to be like, this is not the case for the team I work on. Employ managers who do thejob well, interact with their teams, have great working relationships with their teams, give praise & recognition when its due, I seevery little recognition from my manager which is a shame as this would allow staff to feel they are valued which in turn will makestaff want to work harder, it all has a knock on effect. If only managers would try it out, start to thank individuals for their efforts,make this publicly known in TIBS but lets not see nominations coming from colleagues & managers just countersigning them, thatmeans nothing as they didn't prepare the original nomination its just policy that they had to countersign it & agree to the commentsmade by colleagues. Lets see more senior managers giving out recognition too, this would have a huge impact on how staff felt ifpraise was coming from senior managers, I know there are some individuals who do their upmost to help the business, do workoutside their day to day job but get very little recognition for this, again this needs to be recognised. Let managers change theirways start to recognise the great work being done & I firmly believe the company will reap the benefits, its all about showing staffhow much they are appreciated. Think about it, if someone tells you you did a great job, how does that make you feel? Good,chuffed, thrilled to bits, well its all has knock on effect to how that person feels & reacts in work on a day to day basis, please workmore on recognising staffs efforts, you really will see the benefits.                                                                          Senior Caseworkers paid a higher amount to reflect their skills , knowledge, experience and qualifications! - not just "A2" Band D(starting salary 19k). These are the people that single handedly ensure the their own teams, offices and the LAA runs smoothly andeffectively, these are who providers deal with on a daily basis, it takes years and years to acquire this amount of knowledge.extremely valuable to the organisation.In private sector, in an equivalent position senior caseworkers would be paid double/treble.Also - a lot of "A1" staff, e.g. Escape cases, whereby they should clearly be A2, the work they carry out is highly technical andthey're one of few in the country that are responsible and capable to carry out this work.We are never going to attract great minds/graduates with starting salaries for certain jobs which require a high level of technicalexpertise being £16k. Just saying'!For the record, I am neither a senior caseworker or part of the Escape case team. My                                                                           s are independent and do not reflect anymember or the team as a whole.                                                                          Senior Management should listen to their staff and not act in a bullying or intimidating way.                                                                           Senior managers and Executives need to publicly and privately demonstrate the key values, behaviours and competencies, and beseen to do support them not 'do as I say, not do as I say'. Unacceptable behaviour and conversations get out and around.                                                                           Senior Managers making positive and effective decisions, which they are prepared to defend and be accountable for.Recognition of genuine success and commitment - and this should be done by managers without the need for nominations fromcolleagues. I.e. Genuine awareness by managers of what their staff are doingManaging poor performance: At the LAA it is apparent that poor performing staff are not necessarily managed as effectively as theyshould be, or with at adequate level of response. If specific staff members are not encouraged to change their attitudes/habits inthe workplace or are allowed to continue 'taking advantage' it has an extremely negative impact for immediate colleagues and thewider organisation.There has been a huge focus on engagement in the past year but I am not convinced that it can always be described as "genuine"engagement. Simply telling staff they are being engaged or need to engage themselves does not necessarily equate to meaningfulengagement in which staff feel valued for the work they do and empowered to voice their opinions or concerns. There have beenrecent engagement events at which staff have raised specific concerns, but the response from senior staff has been vague orunrelated to the issue. To feel properly engaged staff need to be assured that managers do take note of specific issues that areaffecting specific staff, and that these issues should not simply be brushed under the carpet in order to promote an illusion that weare working in an "engaged" environment.                                                                          Senior Managers/Exec Team Members being taught about how to behave properly and how to treat their team well.                                                                           Settled future in which we will know the impact CCMS is likely to have on staff numbers and also the future for the continuedassistance for Legal Aid funded clients.                                                                           Share SLG objectives with staff.                                                                           Sincere inclusion and fair treatment for all! A focus on genuine people management will make LAA a better place to work.                                                                           So much focus again has been put on job opportunities in London if we could see more outside of this 1 city it would be positive                                                                           Some confidence that permanent contracts will be offered. It is very difficult to plan for the future and move on in life (such assecure a mortgage) without the security of a permanent contract. Likewise, efforts by senior management to encourageengagement and discussion there of, are very difficult to stomach in the climate of office closures and fixed term contracts.                                                                          Some of the changes that are taking place are imposed political decisions, and I disagree with many them, so it is difficult to seehow these could be changed.However it would be nice to have a clearer picture of what the future holds. I work in civil case management and it is still unclearwhat the future holds for us. One minute we are being told that we can expect over 200 job losses by April 2014 and then we aretold that might not be the case. Then there is the question of how these potential losses will be achieved, redundancy or naturalwastage through reduction of temps / contract staff. Then there’s talk of some criminal work currently done by the courts beingtransferred to the LAA but it is unclear where that work will go and how it will be staffed.There are also no opportunities to develop a career in civil case management, unless you wish to micro manage staff and be tiedup with endless amounts of stats / worksheets.I am also concerned that there is still very much the ‘them and us’ culture between departments in 102 PF.                                                                          Some of the management in Case Management retains an attitude that is not always constructive and breaking down thesebarriers would help our day jobs.It remains a challenge in several areas to establish who is responsible for something and who can then take ownership of aproblem and this can lead to frustration and wasted time spent trying to work out who can (& should) be doing something. Forexample, I recently had a problem with a provider getting a refund following payment of a Claim2 but I could find no-one to takeresponsibility for dealing with it (we tried Cash Office, Finance Queries, & Payment Info and kept getting referred between them -thanks eventually to [NAME] who got someone to deal).                                                                          Some sort of trolley service in the mornings for snacks and hot drinks.

Currently it is only available externally at substantial cost, I'm sure access to online materials could bepurchased across the MoJ or for the civil service learning site. People would happily to pay to take an exam if they had the timeand access to materials to learn.                                                                          Staff arguments need to be sorted out and settled effectively by managersWorkingenvironment orfacilities                                                                          Staff need to feel more valued                                                                           Staff not taken for granted & acknowledgement of the extra work we often have to do                                                                           Stop being crisis driven and more co-operation between departments and external agencies.                                                                           stop contracting out services / supplies to private sector organisations who overcharge , under deliver and couldn't give a tossabout service or requirements eg ATOS                                                                           Stop discriminating against people with mental health problems. It makes a mockery of [NAME] signing up to mental healthinitiatives to combat discrimination.Stop making top down decisions on matter such as new standard operating decisions and IT.

Suppression of dissent, whether by direct means, e.g. "your negative attitude isunhelpful and shows a lack of team spirit" or by ring-fencing dissenters, is poor business and means that management reporting ishopelessly inadequate.                                                                          Stop pushing Engagement activities on staff, not all staff wish to join in the sessions or feel it forms part of their day to day jobs.Some people wish to come in complete their work and then leave.

Some people just want to come in and do a good job then go homeand forget about work and spend time with Family. This now seems to be getting harder and harder as line managers are saying ifno one will volunteer than they will be made to do group exercises.                                                                          Subject to good performance a pay rise that at least kept pace with inflation                                                                           Support for managers when they have to make difficult decisions, and when they are managing staff performance and behaviours.                                                                           Support managers more. In a transitioning environment, too much HR competence is expected of managers and the forums forsharing best practice aren't in place.                                                                           Support staff who has a need to work from home in a better way.Workingenvironment orfacilities                                                                          Systems - IDP can't be launched soon enough.                                                                           Tackle bad behaviour and negativity head on. Really highlight that colleagues can raise issues & concerns but in the right way.Emphasise that feedback needs to be constructive, not just negative without offering solutions. SMT already offer telephone daysetc which are a great idea but tend to appeal to colleagues who want to have a good moan. As an organisation we need to spendour time with colleagues who are positive have the right attitude, good behaviour and are full of ideas to make the LAA a betterplace to work.                                                                          Tackle inappropriate behaviour effectively and manage people better.Listen converse with people doing the work before making decisions which effect their work particularly when we don't agree withthe decision made.Ensure employees are competent enough to do the work they are given It is incredibly annoying seeing some appoint a certainwork such as QC or appeal admin when they don't have the necessary skills to carry out the task.Better communication with providers, it is understandable why they get frustrated and don't know how to submit claims because weare forever changing our minds and not consulting providers on this.                                                                          Tackle poor behaviour low attendance and people not working their proper hours. People who do a good job are put upon morethan people who do not complete their work load rather than tackling the issue.                                                                           tackle poor performance Performancemanagement                                                                           Tackle unacceptable behaviour, and create a workplace where everyone is expected to act professionally, regardless of theirpersonal feelings in respect of anyone else All too often it feels like working in a playground environment with some managersseemingly reluctant to engage with certain individuals and tackle inappropriate behaviour.Invest in our IT and create the systems/tools we need to manage providers effectively. All too often the response seems to be thatwe can't improve our IT because it's too expensive we do have the resource etc etc and we experience the same problems yearafter year with progress only actually being made/action taken when we reach crisis point with regard to system functionality.                                                                          Tackling poor performance and "undesirable" staff behaviour needs to improve in order to make the LAA a top-class place to work.Hard working committed staff sometimes feel undermined and let down by unreliable or occasionally unapproachable colleaguesHR processes orprocedures                                                                           Take a more realistic approach to the resources (human and otherwise) required to do certain work.                                                                           Take away the work sheets. You sometimes feel rushed to get through work some days, leading to getting stressed.

The pettiness of it all is and draconian enforcement of rulesquite ridiculous. Complaints made against people such as this in the past have not been upheld and I have very little confidencethey would be considered fairly in the future.A decent, inflation based pay rise would be good, since we haven’t had one for almost half a decade.                                                                          The ability to be promoted within the LAA rather than having to leave to move upward                                                                           The Agency needs misses opportunities to give staff learning experiences outside of civil service learning,for example why not leteverybody have the opportunity of presenting some element of a TIBS Meeting this would give the team actual involvement in thepresentation and give them public speaking skills.Give staff at lower level more responsibility not just the people that in theirpersonal                                                                            have the skills.I have been here long time and not once have i actually been given chance to mentor or beresponsible for anything while staff who have been here less than 3 years have been given the chance to do new things,thereforesomeone might think what is the point of learning opportunities when at local level your line manager doesn't think you are capableof doing something.I feel very confident i could be a team leader or manager however there is no way in my                                                                            that my managers would evencontemplate me having a opportunity to achieve this.The same people present TIBS meetings we should be getting EVERYONE involved in the weekly TIBS Meeting.Senior Management need to consult staff at local level more before making decisions.For example our work storage places changed overnight without any manager actually explaining in detail why this was being donewhich gave the impression that senior managers really dont care how decisions affect them.Im personally trying to improve staff engagement by holding events within the office and trying to have positive effect within theteam.Management need to listen to staff at local level more not just impose things without taking staffs                                                                           s into account before takingdecisions.trust in [name] ability not just there own                                                                            of whether someone can do something.One decision that i could not understand was opening the office on Christmas eve last year the reason given was for customerservice reasons which meant legal caseworkers left early while admin had to stay to answer the phone till 5 [govt minister(s)]- theactual facts were that we received only 3 calls all day hardly any post etc the cost effectiveness of opening the office in thesecircumstances would not pass a cost benefit test and if you closed the office would leave staff thinking you appreciated the hardwork they had done for you during the previous twelve months.The cost effectiveness of training days for teams to other offices does not make sense for example 30 x £ 50 = £1500 in price of railtickets when one or two people could have delivered the same presentation by video conference or come down to brighton for theday saving at £1400 ie 2 people coming down.                                                                          The attendance Policy which has the potential to discriminate against disabilityGreater financial reward for the level of responsibility I holdRe-evaluate the cuts in scope                                                                          The chance to develop into a new role, lots of jobs are currently ring fenced to budget codes and there appears to be no way tocross over to a different team.Our team has very little communication and we have a TIB that is only updated when it has to be because some one senior isvisiting.                                                                          The changes that are coming through the engagement champions aren't at a fruition stage, however, I am enjoying the changesthat are coming through, particular to team events. Maybe more should be done nationally in this regard.I am aware that this is the only free text available throughout the survey. This may place the survey at a disadvantage as peoplemay have waited until the end to enter feedback. There are some questions within the survey that I am not comfortable with forexample, I have been asked do I have a strong personal attachment with the LAA. No I do not, but this is due to my status as afixed term appointee. I enjoy my work, I enjoy coming to work, I get involved with the organisation, but I can't allow myself tobecome personally attached, because my employer has the flexibility to terminate my contract. As a result of this and my status asa fixed term appointee I cannot apply for a mortgage or move house. I am happy in my work but not secure. As a result I amactively seeking employment outside the LAA, which is not what I want to be doingAnother question has asked when I you want to leave the LAA (CO1). I do NOT want to leave, this is the problem. With the majorityof the workforce in temporary contracts the LAA retains control, thus placing its workforce at disadvantage. I believe the LAA workforce has skills and qualifications that the LAA has not tapped into, I personally would like to say at the LAA and progress to SMTlevel.                                                                          The changes that have been made have been necessary and are positive however the changes (staff engagement) should bedone gradually. Senior Managers are asking for volunteers to present meetings, attend meetings and although this is vital, staff feelpressurised into thinking they are going to be asked to present etc and this is not everyone strong point.... It sometimes feels likeyou cannot say "No" to something you may not feel comfortable doingIt would be nice to build confidence between teams (smaller group meetings) like the lunch "n" learn sessions are a good idea asmore than one person from your team attends and helps individual confidence/engagement. Lunch "n" Learn sessions should beimplemented more.                                                                          The company should strive to excellence performance, have a strong customer satisfaction focus, staff satisfaction and a goodoperational process. continue encouraging people on improvement to acquire new knowledges and new skills.                                                                           The concentration on targets is ridiculous and the pressure being placed on us is unmanageable.I appreciate how important targets are for SMT but the way this is communicated to the front line adds pressure and can beunbearable.we are working at full capacity and cannot do anymore and if we can do anymore I don't see why it should be pushed any furtherwhen the current targets are well within our service level agreements. Every time a category of work is completed quicker thaninitially planned the target days reduce and this is used as a precedent going forward.the weekly efficiency and non process stats are a bit of a waste of time. individuals tend to work to their capacity and if their nonprocess is higher than usual then is because a task has been set which needs to be completed. providing war and peace on why itis high each time this occurs if a waste of time and resources.I feel like I need to justify my working week in order to fit the norm in respect of targets.                                                                          The drive for engagement is the right way to go but perhaps some of the time spent should also focus on how well supported linemanagers are, rather than just front line staff.                                                                           The executive team listening to people on the front line more                                                                           The focus on managing under performance is a good one and is true for all teams. It must extend (and be seen to extend) to staffat senior levels where poor (especially controlling) behaviour has been tolerated for too long.Performancemanagement                                                                           The grading system as this has caused the majority of issues since transfer                                                                           The hot desking policy. It doesn't engender a good working environment if there are not enough desks for a team to be able towork properly at. there is not nearly enough space for work to be stored because of the absurd policy of locking papers away everyevening.                                                                          The internal recruitment process of staff.I suggest the use of external regional managers to screen score the applications to eliminate/reduce bias and promote impartialitythereafter they also be involved in the moderation process to further promote transparency                                                                          The introduction of progression and promotion based upon exceptional performance.                                                                           The LAA as become very much a process/target organisation from what was a people organisation. You are managed/performancemanaged by a series of targets in which you have no involvement in setting and then your 'objective is to met that target which ineffect is someone else's objective This is a way of managing a business and many businesses are run this way but the LAA ishypocritical in that it brands itself as an organisation where you "set" your objectives, (which in fact are short term targets), whenin reality the centre does this and then you are just expected to meet them. Fine but the organisation needs to be up front aboutthis.                                                                          The LAA is already a great place to work, it really listens to [name] concerns and trys if possible to accommodate ideas , wherethat is not possible it explains why. I am new to case management and have never felt more welcome in any role than I have incase management                                                                          The LAA would be a better place to work if the split between different parts of the Agency (Civil, Criminal, IT, Service Development,etc.) and between different teams within those parts were lessened. There is too big a divide, which makes it difficult to feelinvolved with the agency as a whole, impairs the organisation's flexibility and agility, and leads to some parts being busier (orperceiving themselves to be) than others.                                                                          The Legal Aid Agency is already a great place to work.                                                                           The Legal Aid Agency needs to be less 'civil service' in its approach and to place more store in the positive contribution it makes tosociety rather than falling in line with the MoJ's way of doing things.                                                                           The Legal Aid Agency should offer existing staff Permanent Contracts rather than Temporary Contracts. I feel that if all staff arePermanent rather than Temporary this would help with the focus on Engagement and Staff Engagement. At the moment theirremains uncertainty around staff who are on Temporary Contracts.Something else                                                                           The line management culture needs to drastically change. At present management is run on the basis of favouritism, with little orno consideration of fairness when recruiting or treatment of staff. There are also too many [manager(s)]s with ill defined or pointlessroles. This grade is very over staffed, and seems to exist to provide individuals with jobs.                                                                          The lines of communication at present are the best they have ever been so keep up the good work Communications                                                                           The Location of the office.Workingenvironment orfacilities                                                                          The managers could try, oh, I dont know, managing? There appears to be a great reluctance to 'manage and a huge emphasis on'being our friends'; when I have commented this to a manager I got the response 'be careful what you wish for'.Many of the questions in this survey have asked for feedback around the issue of whether the organisation are open to us givingour opinions and ideas. We probably can't be faulted for that, as we are often encouraged to express ourselves. What has longsincestarted to [name] on people is that this is a tick-box exercise and nothing will be done with our ideas, opinions, or feedback.Our ability to manage change would be smoother and less painful if the organisation took notice of the opinions of the people in thebasement who know how things work and are likely to be effected, rather than the Exec Team sitting in the penthouse being paid totheorise about what is going on or likely to happen. The Surge was a shambles on the ground - I'm not sure whether that wasreflected in the corporate video that was sent around as no one that I've spoken to had the software to be able to run the whole film(mine got stuck at 1:49 mins) - and our somewhat cavalier approach to ensuring that we stayed in target has now started to causeproblems for clients.We are not encouraged to think of our colleagues in other offices as "us" rather than "them" , so often our actions thwart eachother. Some offices run the (unofficial?) policy that they cannot e-mail individual caseworkers in another office. This is ludicrous,time-wasting, counter-productive to the organisation running efficiently and re-enforces the notion that we are each other's rivals.                                                                          The obsession with saving money Some areas e.g.staffing are curtailed leaving some teams struggling while funds are alwaysavailable for 'projects'which may or may not add value to the business. Also I have a feeling of certain people having a meteoricrise to fame which smacks of favouritism & face fit scenarios.                                                                          The option to work a weekend as part of a normal working week should be made available for those who struggle with child carecosts. Something else                                                                           The pay should reflect the degree of responsibility given for the work undertaken. In the previous civil service departments I'veworked in over the last 32 years, I have never had as much responsibility for decision making in such a low grade. As an A1 (BandE) in previous departments no decisions especially in respect of financial matters, are given to this grade.                                                                          The problems with IT and the problems it can cause when I work remotely are very frustrating, this creates a lot of wasted time andinefficiency. This does need to be addressed. IT systems                                                                           The promotion side of the agency is flawed, people that have worked for the agency for some time should not have to go throughthe whole inter                                                                           process rather a portfolio system should be in place. The questions asked in the inter                                                                           are not flexible andif a person is not good at inter                                                                          s or selling themselves the chance of being promoted is slim. It does not seem fair that somepeople who may be good at giving the model answers will get a promotion but not be any good at the job, where as some peopleare good at the job they do but not good at promotions, there is no discretion for the managers who know the individual to have asay in the promotion of these individuals.HR processes orprocedures                                                                           the recruitment / promotion procedure should be handled externally otherwise these is no point applying in the office I work in.Every time it is the friends or relations of management who get the job, leaving everyone else to make up the numbers.                                                                           the same rules applied to everyone                                                                           The time standards on some work types, in particular FAS is absolutely criminal. There is no way after doing all the checksPROPERLY, and making all the checks and changes introduced after every consistency meeting, that 7 hours worth can beachieved per day.Less focus on quantity of work, and fees, and targets, and to focus on legal issues, i.e. not paying things out of scope (Where allyour money is being lost).Introduce regular training and alternative routes, do not just shoehorn people down certain work routes.Introduce actual career opportunities for caseworkers, there has only been 1 promotion in this office in the past 15 years. How onearth is that progress? why would I be interested in staying when there is no progress/end game? (Even retail shops and bookieshave fast track management courses, there is nothing like that here).Cut down on the temporary contracts and introduce Permanent ones. Why would temporary workers be passionate about thecompany they work for and therefore care about the work they do, if their contracts run out every 6 months and they all think theyare leaving?                                                                          The underhanded manner bringing out a job description which is the A3 job description after a few months of moving over to theMOJ and now finding you've been promoted as you are now acting above the A2 grade however on the same money as old A3.                                                                           The variety of work for the staff, career development opportunities.                                                                           The way in which recruitment takes place and the system and scoring that is used in it. HR processes orprocedures                                                                           The ways in which you can succeed                                                                           The work flow, as work is being sent here there and everywhere. Caseworkers should have their own desks, and desk hoppingabolished. The new reforms should be clear and transparent We have had a poor increase on our income, yet process complexwork, had to adhere to LASPO reforms and transfer from LSC to the MOJ. There is constant problems with the computer system,hopefully this will be resolved when IDP comes into force.                                                                          The working environment and IT systems could always be improved                                                                           There are a high number of FTA's within the LAA. In order to get the best from staff job security should be a high priority, We havebeen told that this is being looked at but have yet to hear anything. Whilst there is a lot of talk regarding training etc the onlytraining available to all staff is on-line based training which does not take into account different learning styles which personally forme is not a good way to learn.There is a lot of talk regarding the new PMR system which looks at work as well as behaviours and staff are being encouraged todo extra duties to take them "up" in the behaviours category. Whilst some staff are happy to take part in extra duties, this does notmean that staff who come in and do their job to a good standard should be penalised.There appears to be very little opportunities to develop within the LAA. I would like to have more casework experience but unless Iwant to get involved with the TIB or "Engagement" then there is very little opportunity.Senior managers are visible and are keen to listen to feedback however there are little signs that anything is being done with thecomments/feedback which becomes frustrating for all staff.                                                                          There are pockets of areas where behaviours of some staff are not consistent with the wider LAA. These areas are being tackledthrough excellent senior appointments but there also needs to be a cultural change which will take longer to embed. The SeniorLeadership Group have a big role to play in this and should include this as part of future agenda items                                                                          There has been great improvements,especially in senior staff being more approachable and trying to ensure we work hard andenjoy doing so. This has greatly improved the working atmosphere.There is still a need to ensure all senior staff are managed to ensure they model the expected behaviours.                                                                          There have been great improvements in many areas in the last year. There remain a few areas where things could be better, and Iappreciate that these have been identified and are being worked on. This is reassuring as it indicates that the organisation isindeed listening to staff and seeking their                                                                           s for how and what can be done better and smarter. In Contract Management, MI isstill an issue, the new OBIEE is not yet fully functional as it is still being developed, this will be key to ongoing management ofproviders and spotting where things might be going wrong. Although Blackberry phones are useful, the fact that there is no signalfor them whilst at my desk in the Birmingham office is pretty frustrating, as is the fact that this has been complained about on manymany occasions and has still not been resolved. Otherwise, there have been huge improvements. I now feel valued, listened to,considered as a key contributor to the overall objectives of the organisation, and thus, (despite the fact that I am rather bored doingthe job and acknowledge that there are not really any development opportunities), I am quite happy.                                                                          There is a clear division between the more senior members and "junior" members of staff. This results in disrespect and unfairtreatment of lower members of staff. Something needs to be done about this discrimination.                                                                           There is a huge culture of people who have been at the organisation for years and are very set in their ways. They look solely atproblems rather than causes of problems, ie why is everyone sick? Because they have been working flat out for 6 months to keepgreen. Why is productivity going down compared to last 6 months? because people are working to rule due to the lack of supportwhen they were sick. People are genuinely fearful of certain managers due to this and rightly so.                                                                          There is a lack of opportunity to develop following the change to MoJ. Also the lower bands eg e and F (formerly A1) should berecognised for exceptional performance rewards/bonus' as they are working just as hard as the higher bands.                                                                           There is a lot of negativity within the Agency from staff that have been with the agency a while. This negativity seems to stem fromfrustrations about pay and conditions and whilst I understand that I feel that something needs to be done to tackle the issue. Payand conditions are not going to get much better and it is about time that that lesson was learnt, they could always try spending 6months on the dole like I did - it is not pleasant. There is a youthfulness and energy from the more recent members of staff whichmeets with a brick wall when new initiatives are tried, particularly when those initiatives are aimed at attempting to engage with thevery people who refuse to do so. It sometimes feels like I am working with sulking toddlers.                                                                          There is a wide range of skills and abilities in the Band D grade following the merger of the A2/A3 grades, though work is stillbroadly allocated along the old A2/A3 lines. Whilst I appreciate there is always going to be a range, more should be done to bridgethe gap and achieve parity of work in the band, particularly between those at the old A3 grade.                                                                          There is an increase on staff turnover which reduces the feeling of cohesiveness and consistency within the LAA. The valuesappear to be more quantity driven as opposed to quality.                                                                           There is far too much emphasis on engagement. I feel that people are rewarded for not actually doing work. People spend hourseach day sorting out meetings about engagement and forcing others to come up with ideas, and will then received reward andrecognition vouchers for this. The people that complete the complex work and answer queries etc receive no recognitionwhatsoever. I feel that this is unfair as processing complex work and acting as a focal point to assist with queries should be morerecognised than spending time telling people to engage more.Out of the team meetings we have daily, I would say that approximately 15-20 minutes is spent each day talking about engagement.                                                                          There is no informal way of making Senior Managers aware of Line Manager behaviours. At visits everything appears well, but thereality of the last 12 months is very different The moods and switch between control to disinterest is very difficult to adapt to. Younever know if you are going to evoke a positive or negative reaction and sometimes that depends on the day. I would never raiseanything formally as we are a small team and it would make things unbearable, but I do wish Senior Managers witnessed somebehaviours.                                                                          There is not much that can be changed as it is the work itself that is not stimulating.                                                                           There is so much focus on engagement and keeping the grades at frontline (i.e. caseworkers) happy for fear of the unioninvolvement, bad staff survey results, not creating a family style environment etc that I see managers and senior managerspandering to too many frivolous demands from caseworkers, hence encouraging an attitude of entitlement instead of one ofownership and responsibilityIn one Executive visit session, I heard a caseworker say they had been at the agency for years and had never been asked whatskills they brought with them and were just given the training for the job they were hired and that was it. They felt they should havebeen asked and that was not right. The Senior Manager responded that yes they should have been asked.But why does any adult need to be asked? Why is your development someone elses responsibility and not yours? I haven’t reallyfelt developed proactively by my manager and so answered the questions as such.However I do not feel that it is my managers’ responsibility I know I can ask someone if I want to. Why didn’t Senior Managementpush back and set that caseworker right there and thenTherefore I think the questions that should be asked whether in a survey or in other forums “Have you asked for development?“What was the result?” “Were you encouraged or discouraged”It should only be someone elses responsibility they have actively hindered you from developing when you wanted to.Have you felt bullied or discriminated against? I agree there are genuine cases of this that occur. However I also know acaseworker who felt picked on by a Quality Checker because she was getting errors and took it so personally that at a later stageencouraged an opportunity to “get her back”. There was nothing wrong with the delivery of the feedback the Quality Checker gavebut guaranteed if this survey asked that question at the time or the matter had never come to light and been able to have beenresolved, the caseworker would have held it as a grudge and said that she had felt bullied.Sometimes people’s personalities are such that everything is taken personally and the surveys do not take this into account.Middle managers are the ones who are liaise and act as the buffers between senior management and caseworkers layers,especially during times of change and cascading harsh messages. They have to absorb a lot of frustration and negativity, directedat them on a daily basis. This has been a significantly tough year within Case Management with LAR, moving into MOJ and IDP.However in order to create the atmosphere of an open and approachable environment, I see that caseworkers are oftenencouraged to go directly to senior management with issues and not being directed back to their manager or supervisors, to try andresolve first. And I have seen middle managers decisions being overturned, if the caseworker speaks to the right senior manager.In local surveys and engagement committees, middle managers are not given the same chance to voice their opinion in factmanager’s opinion is overshadowed and favoured for that of the caseworkers.I have experienced this, dealt with it and moved on. However I felt it was important to highlight this as an issue. Middle managersneed to be supported openly, as they do what the business what the business has hired them to do. They are in a tough positionevery day, at every briefing supporting the business.                                                                          There need to be more bands to successes in line with pay. At present I am judged in the same band for competency and salaryas new staff, poorly performing staff or under performing staff as there is no band between good and poor performance that theother staff could be dropped into. I understand that Management do not want to reduce these staff to the lowest band and notincrease pay, but it is unfair that staff performing to a high level cannot be banded as such.                                                                          There needs to be a greater recognition by some teams that we are 'all in it together' and that poor customer service (includingfailure to respond to providers in a reasonable time frame) impacts on colleagues working to improve provider behaviour. If we holdproviders to a high standard of accountability and expect them to meet tight deadlines, we have to hold ourselves accountable tothe same high standard.On a personal note, I'd like a permanent desk of my own. The need to juggle diary appointments so that I am not arriving at theoffice at an awkward time plus the fact that I cannot easily work from home owing to personal circumstances adds a minor irritant toeveryday life.                                                                          there needs to be consistency in the way employees are treated by their managers. This can only lead to higher productivityamongst employees. There also needs to be more openness; less countless amounts of managers' meetings behind closed doors.                                                                           There needs to be greater understanding that the decisions at the top of the structure have a huge impact on those lower down andwhile this is often unavoidable, recognition of this fact should be more evident.                                                                           There needs to be more help with assisting career development and progression My work                                                                           There should be less focus on trying to engage employees with 'engagement activities' and other such tasks and allow us to carryout our roles with little disruption. There is too much focus on engagement with managers that is distracting employees from ourday jobs which ends up having a more detrimental effect and creates more stress and less engagement. Create an environmentwhere people feel comfortable enough to open up when they are stressed or do not feel engaged instead of forcing it. This, ifanything, will create the opposite effect in that individuals will be apprehensive to open up as it differs from what is expected ofthem. Even surveys such as this one can cause distress as people do not feel like they can open up as the surveys do not feelvoluntary despite being stated as being so and ask too many personal questions. This makes individuals uncomfortable with theiranonymity. Also, the engagement representatives in offices (something that I do agree with in theory should be a proper, diversecross-section of the office and have the interests of their colleagues as their priority, instead of their own development, and takethe time to get to know their colleagues on a more personal level if they expect to engage with them.                                                                          They need to evaluate certain roles more effectively - it seems to me that far too many people go unrewarded - including pay fortheir achievements including the enormous sums they save the tax payer.No effective pay rise clearly shows that (irrespective of austerity) that being a public servant is not a role which can be effectivelyrewarded                                                                          They need to think before they act. The same thing keeps happening where we get an e-mail saying we need to do something. Itclearly hasn't been thought through as its just a knee jerk reaction to a problem. We then go out and at times cause chaos only tobe told of a different approach a few days/weeks down the line. I have learnt never do what is asked on the first e-mail as you canguarantee it will change completely in a few days.                                                                          They should make their decision quicker as to what they are going to do with those employees who are on temporary contract. Something else                                                                           They sometimes make changes drastically without looking at the bigger picture and impact it will have, then only to decide thedecision wasn't right and change it again. I think finding the opinions more regularly of the people the changes will affect, will helpthem decide beforehand instead of listening when it goes wrong and its too lateManaging change                                                                           This is an extremely difficult question as on the whole I feel the organisation is extremely poorly managed.The laissez-fair attitude to poor quality casework is intolerable, and the number of people who are incapable of performing their jobis something that would not be tolerated in the private sector.These people are not appropriately challenged on their performance, and to add insult those who perform well are treated the sameas those who perform incredibly badlyThis has been standard practice for so long now, that many of these poor performers have found their way into Senior Caseworkerand even Management-level grades (since previous performance is not even considered in the recruitment process, which isfrankly outrageous). The fact that poor performance is tolerated at every level of the organisation properly explains why we are inthe state we are in, and why things are unlikely to change while these people remain in post.Tackle poor performance. If it doesn't improve get rid of those who are failing and replace them by people who are competent.Reward consistently good performance. It's the only way to improve                                                                          This is hard to answer as I know some people who love their jobs and love working for the LAA. There needs to be help to ensurethat people who are line managers are the most appropriate to do the job and are given regular training in empathy and coaching,an annual update might be good. It is not an easy decision to raise a grievance but everyone knows who the bad managers areand this should be tackled                                                                          Tighter control in all areas of criminal funding, especially free-standing advice and assistance on appeals and re                                                                          s mattersthrough regulations, cost-effectiveness against Exclusive Schedule Arrangements and analysis of success against funding grantedetc                                                                          Time standards on Correspondence.Format of Exec visits - history of MOJ power point irrelevant and time wasting.                                                                           To allow all staff more time to be involved with areas outside the own role, eg, shadowing at courts or to be involved with providervisits.

Listen to the staff who actually process the work, rather then managers impose things on us that do not processthe work. To treat all staff equally and not have favourites, and not to give some members of staff special treatment. To keep thingsconfident, to ask a member of staff before personally information is shared/announced to the rest of the team. To listen to yourideas and take them on board.                                                                          To be more business orientated and less woolly in it's policies                                                                           To be more understanding and supportive towards individuals who have difficulties                                                                           To be open and transparent regarding job losses, I do not want to lose my job but would like to be prepared if it was likely to happen                                                                           To be treated fairly and to be involved with everything is going on within the company regardless of what area you work in                                                                           To be treated less like a production line and more like people                                                                           To become more realistic with it objectives and time frames. The LAA is often ambitious with regard to its large-scale changes andthis often leads to unrealistic targets and goals. The LAA needs to learn that planning of a large project often takes longer than thebuild and implementation. It needs to understand the process of design and how unrealistic demands will pressurise a workforceinto providing a "suitable for purpose" result instead of a "gold standard" result.They should also invest in internal training of staff to undertake roles that are farmed out to agencies and freelance workers; and,ensure that when this is undertaken the people involved actually want to be involved. By buying in to the education anddevelopment of a member of staff you will get a better performance and lower costs in the long term.                                                                          To carry on the same as there have been many improvements regarding engagement in this office over the last 12 months                                                                           To challenge certain behaviours and act in more transparent and open manner. Fairness and consideration to all not just selectfavourites. To look after the welfare of ALL staff regardless of grade, gender, education and colour.

A "customer" a person who purchases goods or services from another and I'm not sureif a recipient of legal aid can be classified as a customer of Legal Aid.                                                                          To offer permanent vacancies to staff and disclose all information they would want to know.If senior management have a long term plan of transferring all Crime work over to Nottingham then I suggest you inform staff of thisplan instead of slowly transferring work flows every 2 months with the excuse of "reducing our workload". This is the main reasonwhy some people may have an "us" and "them" approach to work, as people are being kept in the dark about long term plans.The same can be said about permanent contracts, I fail to believe that after 2.5 years of working as a temp that senior managementstill dont know if they can provide a permanent job.

There needs to be a move awayfrom management by spreadsheet and a cultural change so that when we look at making the LAA a better place to work weactually mean it and have some long terms strategies in place as to how this will be achieved rather than doing a knee jerk reactionto the survey and picking out the 3 worst areas or things we can change quickly.                                                                          To re                                                                           the closure of the Chester office as the valuable knowledge and the fabulous working relationship we all have will bepartially lost.                                                                           To speak to employee who do the work before making changes and take their experience and knowledge into account.                                                                           To walk before they can run, too much change happens at once and puts staff/managers under extreme pressure, deal with eachchange individually in order to make the change a smooth transition                                                                           Too be less bureaucratic. Sometimes the relationship between staff and managers is almost like that of student and teacher. Forexample, when we have a PDR meeting there are specific and detailed orms to fill in, etc. The meeting between manager and teammember should be less formal, with the manager simply asking if anything there are any general issues or concerns regarding workand making a note of these and carrying them forward if appropriate. Also, decisions/changes regarding work processes should bemade in consultation with those that process the work and not made for them.                                                                          Training could be made easier with written instructions                                                                           training for managers on bringing the best out of employeesto have a culture of not making people feel guilty for working part timea pay rise                                                                          Transparency within management.                                                                           Travel Allowance Pay and benefits                                                                           Treat all its staff equally at least.                                                                           Treat all people with respect.

For example, one team has to complete time sheets whereas the other is exempt.                                                                          Treat everyone fairly and actually listen to issues raised by staff even if they are not what management wants to hear                                                                           Treat fairly Something else                                                                           Treat their employees on a par with those of the same qualification within the rest of the Civil Service                                                                           Treat/grade me fairly and in line with others with a comparable role to me in the MOJ/wider government; and resolve this issue inan appropriate time frame. So far the dragging out of, and unwillingness to address an, unfair procedure (and decisions flowingfrom that) have made the working life of myself and my colleagues a misery for circa 18 months.Value/respect me and the work I do.                                                                          Treating temporary staff better. It's not acceptable to leave staff who have been here 2+ years hanging on temporary contracts, noris it acceptable to 'dangle the carrot' in front of them by offering a select number of permanent contracts under the default MoJconditions (37 hours a week, reduced holidays, no flexible time) and expecting caseworkers to apply for their own jobs. These arethe terms I'm aware of staff in other offices being told about. They should be treated the same as existing permanent staff; we weregiven better, transitional arrangements upon transfer to the MoJ after the Unions became involved, so why haven't the temporarystaff been given the same opportunity? There are lots of skilled temps, who would be a big loss to CCM if they left.Managing poor performance more effectively. What is the point of managers 'being aware' of a problem individual and burying theirhead in the sand refusing to act on it?                                                                          Unfortunately, it doesn't matter what changes I would like to see within the Agency to make it a better place to work asManagement would NEVER implement them anyway. It's always been "do as I say, not as I do".                                                                           Use statistics as indicators and not the be-all and end-all when looking at team performances. Although stats are the easiest way totrack a team's work levels, looking at the actions and work commitments of those teams should also be important.                                                                           Utilising the changes brought about by IDP, it would be great if we were able to expand the Contract Managers role to implementbetter controls on the fund, and to retrain caseworkers to effectively contribute to CM standards, wherever a surplus of workforce isidentified.Although SMT and ET have been much better at passing information along, I personally feel helpless in the face of what appears tobe [job title] changes coming up. I am kept well informed about change, but not how I can help. Also, there are issues that come upin group meetings where we can ask questions, many people feel uncomfortable to speak up at these meetings, or in my caseoften come up with questions that we feel would make us look silly or ask for a clarification of point.I have thought that the work that I do is simple tasks that could be carried out via automation. Although this will be addressed withIDP, this contributes to a sense of our roles being sisyphean. I think a good thing to implement would be a "Talent Agency" thatgave managers training and skills to identify exceptional colleagues and set them on a more productive path. I think this would beespecially valuable to short term staff like myself, who haven't yet defined themselves within the structure of the Agency, yet arepotentially valuable losses when casework declines following implementation of IDP.                                                                          We all need to be treated the same friendships between line managers and caseworkers should sometimes be put on the backburner while at work.The LAA need to single out the people that are not performing well and try and advise them where they are going wrong and ask ifthey need extra help. A little help goes a long way                                                                          We are living in tight economical times but this also quashes initiative - it would be good to see that it is ok to spend a little moneyon staff activities - visits to other offices, occasional overnight stays, team building exercises - these are the things which galvanisepeople and help them feel part of a wider team.                                                                          We are on the right track and the ET is being more visible within the organisation which is a great improvement on last year. MCMonday's emails help me to understand what is happening and I feel everyone within the ET are more approachable than a yearago. I have personally had 121 with MC and mailed him on subjects I feel is in the best interest of the organisation and he hasbeen willing to listen and taken action or passed on my concerns to someone else to take forward. I have received regular updateson my concerns and what action has been taken I can honestly say that since [NAME] was [SENIOR MANAGER(S)], MC has beenthe best [SENIOR MANAGER(S)] with have had and taking the LAA forward in a Constructive manager and I can see our endgoals.                                                                          We are told the LAA is fair, but how is it fair for those with a disability to automatically get an inter                                                                          ? People who are notproductive are carried by the rest of my team. Rules are ignored on a daily basis. The LAA is all macro and no micro, strongermanagement is needed at an office level to reward those doing well and develop those falling below expected standards.                                                                          We could badly do without the spin. Calling scope/fee reductions reforms is EXTREMELY ANNOYING INDEED .Call them savings not cuts by all means - I am fine with that, the State is perfectly entitled to make unpopular changes . A reform issomething like giving women voting rights , not paying lawyers less or nil for doing something .                                                                          We need a more consistent approach between offices My work                                                                           WE NEED A PERIOD OF STABILITY RATHER THAN MORE CHANGE. CHANGE IS NOT ALWAYS FOR THEBEST.EMPLOYEES NEED TO KNOW WHERE THE LAA ARE GOING AND THAT THEIR JOBS ARE SAFE.NO EMPLOYEESHOULD BE ON FIXED TERM CONTRACTS                                                                          We need to get better at planning and allowing sufficient time to do the job properly. Also need to be more joined up, often find thatI'm being asked for the same information from different people such as what guidance needs to be amended for changes beingimplemented. I often feel that I cannot plan my time because the info I need is not available and I am told that it's not a priority thenwhen it is back on the agenda I dont then have the time to work on it because other pressures have been introduced In generalthere is so little time to do everything that is on our plate that in my new role for the last 12 months I do not feel I do anythingparticularly well or can have any chance of saying that I've exceeded because it is a case of doing what I can which is something Idont feel comfortable with There are also so many issues with recruitment that I've spent a lot of time picking up the work of theothers - people have left and not been replaced for many months or have been off sick etc. This past few weeks for instance I'vehad to pick up the tasks of the level below and the level above because of sickness and still get my own work done In particular,guidance is very badly organised and out of date but there is so little time for me or the subject matter experts to work on updatingit because of the pressure to stay in target with applications and the fact that we are are never fully staffed for very long.Although a lot has been done to get us talking to different people and understanding how we fit in with the whole office (it was areally good idea for the teams to get together to present a joint presentation to the exec team this time) there is still a disconnectbetween people in each team and between the 2 floors of our office. I generally dont recognise a lot of people on the second floorand there is not much effort to introduce new people.                                                                          We need to maintain our powers of self determination; that is to say we should not abandon our work methods (e.g provision ofGuidance) simply because we now form part of the Moj. To do so will create inconsistency and increase the risk to our financialstewardship strategy.                                                                          We should allow freedom to partake in any training above your job description so that we may train for potential promotionprospects. Training is seemingly only allowed for the role you are currently in. If you have been doing the job for a while and haveextensive knowledge to do it well, I feel the current policy tends to limit personal growth.                                                                          when [job title] changes occur, such as LASPO/LAT/CCMS, make sure that all relevant people are involved. I have lost track of theamount of times changes do not go smoothly because key teams who will be part of implementing the change were not involvedearly enough in the process to make a difference.                                                                          When changes take place I don't feel there is sufficient hands on training to give me the knowledge I would like to be confident indoing my job. Also, I would like to see more knowledge shared across departments i.e. not just understanding one part of theprocess i.e. just means or just merits, even the basics like which forms are used for which type of work.                                                                          When decisions are made by senior management on new processes that affect casework processes, it would be good to see thatthere has been strong involvement from caseworkers at the ground level - often, it seems that new practices or policy shifts are putin place that seem good in theory but have had no input from someone who has done casework recently as practical applicationcan be difficult and add to already strained workloads.With regards to developing the LAA and making it a better place to work, I come from a background that has strong social supportnetworks in place (Home Office, LGOs, etc.). Trying to locate similar networks in the MoJ is proving an almost impossible task.While groups exist in name on the intranet, it's as if there is some degree of tokenism - there is no practical support being offeredby peers and so these groups are ineffective and virtually inactive. It could be a good idea for the MoJ to become involved in morehigh-profile national events to show that they are an inclusive employer - as an example, the Home Office has been identified byStonewall as an Equality & Diversity Employer of the Year on a number of occasions through its commitment to championing E&Dissues at high profile events such as Pride and the African Oyé.Lastly, there needs to be a better balance regarding information that is received by caseworkers on a regular basis. As part of thelast survey, it was identified that caseworkers felt distanced due to a lack of information flowing through the offices. The resultingaction has meant that we are now provided with regular updates and bulletins. However, I think there is now too much - we getduplicate information on a daily basis and whatever is sent in e-mail is then discussed at meetings, presentations, team gatherings,then e-mailed back out for further clarification. With so many variations, it is also really easy for conflicting information to getdisseminated alongside information that is irrelevant. While regular information is greatly appreciated, there needs to be a standardsystem and a central point through which these are issued and re                                                                          ed.                                                                          When first started working for LAA (LSC as was) we had scheduled paid breaks, water coolers around the office, breakfast club.There was also many more promotional opportunities. I considered the LSC a great to place work, I consider the LAA an anadequate place to work as all the "perks" of the job have been removed. A lot more pressure has been placed on staff whichmakes the environment a lot more tense.                                                                          When it introduces a new management policy it should realise the implications fully and be fully aware when the policy also appliesto management itself ie it should not pick and choose when how it should apply                                                                           Whilst I understand that we are currently in a recession and there aren't a lot of opportunities available for colleagues to progress, Ifeel that we could be encouraged more to use the development tools available to us so that when a suitable vacancy arises, Iwould feel confident enough to go for the positionAlso, we are being chased by senior management to ensure that our work is processed within target and to provide an accurateupdate of what work is on caseworker's desk and what is on our shelves waiting to be processed.The office that I work in ALWAYS provides senior management with an ACCURATE update of what work is in and out of target.However, I know that other offices who process the same work as us will deliberately fail to disclose what work they have in orderto make themselves look good and I know that senior management turn a blind eye to this!What would make the LAA a better place to work is if the Executive Team got their Senior Management Team to get a grip on whatis happening so that an accurate reflection of what work is in and out of target is declared so that honest and decent offices, likethe one I work in, are not made to feel like they are doing the worst.                                                                          Will have a better idea once all the changes are in force.                                                                           With all the changes that have taken part over the past 12-18 months I do not think enough consideration has been given to themore mature employees who are not computer literate and find it difficult to grasp. Things are rushed through which to the youngerperson is acceptable but not always the elder generation.Something else                                                                           With so many cuts, it would be nice if the Legal Aid Agency could provide a party fund to motivate staff.Workingenvironment orfacilities                                                                          With the overarching direction the Agency is going in due to Government reforms I don't believe that over the next couple of yearsthe Agency could be a great place to work.                                                                           Within my department, communication.                                                                           Work tasks being divided equally across team members of same pay & grade.                                                                           Working on Christmas Eve & New Years Eve.
