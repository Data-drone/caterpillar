Where would you get the employment and skills to have that? That's the problem. So, why would you come to Australia if the dream of having a house and a life is diminished? The problem is that the government is trying to tell ppl what they should do and what they shouldn't do. The government's role is to act as a mediator between the people and the market. But, to be controlling people in that manner, I think is wrong. The government role is not to tell people what to wear and what not to wear. I think that's a concern."

Rights, all the rights defined by the UN. Something that's abided by. Education should be something that is free, no matter what age, sex, religion, background, whatever. It should be respected. Poverty, because of people who are too rich and they don't care. Freedom and right to free speech, which is a right anyway. Climate change and politics. I don't think politicians are listening. Politics is a dirty field, but unfortunately that runs the world. I'm a labor party. I just don't think, I believe, politics is a money scheme. I don't think the world is run by very good politians.

All our companies are being sold to overseas people. We seem to be losing our companies to them. No funds from the government. It seems the country is coming to a stand still. The previous government gave money out left right and centre, and I think that was a mistake. They give money to the aboriginals and they don't appreciate it. A lot o f money is spent on the aboriginies. A lot of waste in this world, in this society. The more you give to people the more they expect and the less they respect it.

I think if we'd not gone into mining; if we'd slowed down and gone into conservation or alternative energies and that kind of thing, rather than digging holes everywhere and just making a few people really rich. I think the European Union has got the right idea, where they won't cut the southern states off because their money's gone off the gurgler. They're keeping them in the European Union. Greece, especially, is going back to traditional ways; they're farming and all that kind of thing, moving out of the city and this is helping the environment - getting away from the big money thing."
