I did not realise that the person making the booking has to travel. I found that confusing
Perhaps allow section where you could ask for clarification on matters - FAQ would be helpful
As I required specialist cover for off road motorbiking I found it fairly difficult to navigate to the page showing what was covered within that specific insurance bracket levels of cover
"I know it is (sort of) in the FAQ, but you could emphasise at time of sale/purchase of annual travel insurance that all travellers on one policy can use their insurance independently... It is useful."
"A little clearer on excess payments, regards who pays what and how much."
Clearer details regarding breakdown cover.
Site needs to say that the no claims period appears on the reminder/renewal document from the current insurer.
Maybe make it clearer what documents you require
perhaps clearer as to whether cruise cover is included. something i'd never thought about before but have been finding it difficult to decipher whether covered on quite a few policies
"The reason I gave a 3 for the 1st 2 questions....It was very difficult to figure out what the excess was; this wasn't made clear at any point of the process and I only got it by reading through the small print of the policy brochure several times. It would have been so helpful to make this more explicit, and to provide this before going to payment. It nearly made me go with another provider because I couldn't find the information - but, despite this (and despite the high cost/excess) I have always had an excellent experience dealing with Endsleigh, they have always been helpful, thorough and human, so this swung my decision!"
The wording about keeping or removing the baggage option from a travel insurance quote on line is confusing.
Very impressed by follow up phone call to check details and confirm we had no questions. My only suggestion to improve would be to add a brief explanation as to what personal accident cover and legal protection actually give you.
"Tried to call but with no joy, just wanted to ask a question... Still never mind I still took out the insurance!"
"I was called with regards to my policy and I then included a couple more items to the policy. I asked about protecting my no claims and she said she would get customer services to call me. I said it would have to be after 5pm as I work. They called me during the day and told me they needed to speak to me and to call them back. I did not think this was very good customer service. If they need to speak to me and I have already stated that I cannot speak before 5pm, that they shouldn't then leave a message asking me to call them back. I cannot complain about the lady I spoke to on the ifrst occasion, she was extremely polite and helpful. Thanks"
"I was very pleased with the internet service. However, when returning a call from yourselves the person answering was very unhelpful and unprofessional and didn't seem to know what he was doing."
"took a long time for an operator to answer the phone, gave up first time after 12 mins. second time answered uickly but gave me higher quote than online."
"did not appreciate a phone call a day after taking out the policy asking me   for the proof of no claim bonus, although the form said I had 14 days to send it in"
SHOULD SEND PAPER WORK VIA E-MAIL WHEN POLICY CONFIRMED AND PAYMENT TAKEN
It would be helpful if like some other company's you contacted the previous insurance company for the no claims details.
MORE TELEPHONE OPERATORS
"Only query being, as to whether I needed to contact you to confirm I would or would not received from you and official 'certificate of motor insurance'."
"There is always a fairly long delay from the call being picked up to actually speaking to an operator - there is music playing during this time, but the delay is annoying as it happens every time."
Agent spoke a little to fast for me at times.
"Endsleigh contacted me by telephone to check some policy details I had provided. The representative I spoke to was very efficient but he he didn't seem personable, or as enthusiastic."
excellent lovely agents who explained and answered my questions with patience my only negative is I havnt been able to access emergency phone number for rac call out should I need to. I have been used to in the past receiving phone card with number along with policy but other than that great many thanks
"I had problems at the check out. And I phoned instead. The 1st call it took ten minutes before I got throught. The 2nd phone call was almost 15 minutes. This is far too long, I started to get very stressed and angry. So quicker service would bring my over all service - as very good"
I hope you will automatically recognise my ncb is already with yourselves and not require a phone call to confirm. Thank you.  ian
Only problem I've had is I haven't yet had my document confirmation to print off otherwise excellent including the price
the welcome e. mail did not give me my policy number
Sent off no claims form but have not heard back from email to confirm it was received. Only sent 24 hours ago but other companies are quicker to confirm. Overall good experience so far in terms of buying.
Telephone contact took all the relevant information then passed me on to a local broker who then went through all my details again then quoted a price more than double Endsleigh's quote on the website.  Needless to say I persevered on the website and got  very good value cover.
"Site was very good, as were the offers.   However, the top  recommended  recommended to me by the site and offered by Endsleigh, did not in fact exist. The offer appeared to be a Confused.com special (stating not available on other sites), including Legal Costs free of charge. When clicking through to Endsleigh's website to finalise the purchase, the deal was not valid and I was asked for an additional 16 on top of the quote. As I do not require legal cost protection this did not impact my purchase but I imagine it would put other visitors off.  Apart from the abovementioned I was very happy with my Confused.com experience.  Best,  Oz Shtrosberg"
"My only gripe is that I was on one of the comparison websites which wasn't loading results so went direct to yours, but upon completion and purchase your quote on the comparison website was cheaper than I had bought direct!"
aving trouble logging in  3.or 4 times   keep s saying dosent reconice password?  d/o/b police no  post code.
had a problem associating my new policy with my existing logon from previous policies. To have some way of improving this association would be good.
"IT issues with old logins not recognising new policy, and new logins unable to create due to old logins, but resolved by call centre. Can we have online chat as this would be easier for hard of hearing as Typetalk calls are slow."
I am having problems opening the information page to access my policy schedule/details. I know that they are there but I am unable to access the information. Otherwise a v/good service.
"whenever i log into my account, its says i have no current policies even though i do?"
I had to ring in because my address had been spelt wrong however I was told it is a computer error because it has to have so many characters therefore a S was added at the end automatically as my home address was less than the minimum required. Seems strange and a weird system but also a waste of my time having to call therefore this is the only part that has been a poor client experience. I can't see where or how I can easily update or change my personal details either
I needed/need to add that the mortgage provider has it written that they have an interest in the property ie Oakwood homeloans/ Skipton on the isurance papers there was no place to state this on line!
I use an Apple Mac and couldn't open my policy document when using Firefox but could when using Safari. Technical glitch somewhere in the system maybe??
"Everything is great, but one of the two policy documents is in aspx format, which can be troublesome to open unless you have the right software."
"Had to contact by telephone as unable to download docs, this always happens when I buy your on-line travel policy, I usually able to download docs by adobe etc.  However when I contacted you by phone the person I spoke to was really helpful and sent by email."
It did seem a bit difficult trying to enter electronic 'account' when I could not remember/access username and password from a previous registration quite some time ago.
"2 Events for travel insurance, had to pay 4 separate times for husband & myself. With other insurance providers you have option to add additional travellers."
"I couldn't update the use of the car to include commuting on your website, so I had to redo my compare the market search to have it selected. So maybe the ability to amend more options to get the full quote I required would be good."
"I created a quote, but then remembered I had forgotten to add details of a previous claim. I was unable to go back and add the details as your website kept showing an error. I had to close and open my browser, and then go back to your website from the link in the email to be able to continue."
Some of the questions did not quite fit my situation. When asked about prior losses one example could only be recorded as electrical where in fact it was a musical instrument case covered with the musical instrument insurance I also have with you
I found it difficult to find the area which covered how much 'No Claims' discount I had and I also found it difficult to find if loss of my vehicles keys where covered.   I also feel the amount of 'Excess' that is eventually shown is a bit misleading and on other sites there is the ability to vary your 'Voluntary excess' and see how this impacts upon the cost of the policy.  However other than these minor points (which I suspect I could have called about (but do not like waisting time on the phone at extra costs to myself lol!) I am very happy so far.
"Varying some of my answers changed the price of the quote (for example, level of excess) - it would be better if these could be changed more easily and the policy quote updated on the fly, rather than having to resubmit the form.  When resubmitting the form I was asked every time if I was a graduate and where I graduated from - the site should remember this information and not ask me repeatedly."
I had trouble with the Natwest bit at the end but thats not your fault. When you give the policy summary before we pay it would be useful if you could state the estimated annual mileage and whether business use is included. I was pretty sure I had included these but had to click back to double check.
Only difficulty I had was I was not able to enter the full first line of my address as it had too many characters to input so the last few letters were left off.
when it came to your employment question I put down on the comparison site that I was a Phlebotomist in a hospital but on your site it gave my occupation as a nurse but one of your reps rang me and I pointed it out and he said he would look into it otherwise everything was realy straight forward.
The drop down menu to select occupation was extremely frustrating to use as it kept scrolling back to the top every time I tried to click on my occupation.
Unable to download information despite following instructions - page froze each time attempted to do this activity.
After completing payment details my laptop froze during the authorisation process of my debit card.  This then timed out and left me unsure as to whether the payment was taken or not.  The fact that I was then sent the insurance documentation and was able to log on to my account assured me that payment was successful although this was not confirmed.
Couldn't fill graduate information in on iPad/iPhone
"Generally very happy with Endsleigh.  One quick comment on website- when you enter information about eg having a laptop, it's not clear that you then need to click the add button rather than just moving on to the next section.  Took me a few irritating minutes to work out why the form wasn't accepting the information I had put in."
Hi after completing and paying a deposit a technical problem arose i was unable  to access the paper work from the site has  i do not have a E_mail address I was unsure if i had become a customer due to the technical fault which happened after completion I am aware the deposit has been taken from my account could you please E_mail me with my insurance certificate and the Terms and Conditions Thankyou Mrs Elliott
Not easy enough to find the graduate insurance
"simple set up and payment, not been able to view and therefore print off policy documents, new browser page opens but no content.  please can you sort for me?  Thanks"
"The website as it stands  loses  insurance  option  settings when you go back to change the main quotation parameters.  I didn't notice the first few times, so this was a bit confusing!"
"When I first tried to renew my insurance for the next year I experienced a problem when paying. I then rang the helpline and was helped by one of your agents but even he couldn't take my payment. While I was on the phone his line manager announced that there was a big problem and even offered to call me back. When I tried 24 hours later, the payment went through without any problems."
The email I received upon buying insurance had a link to a  What happens when I graduate?  question in the FAQ. When I clicked on this it just took me to the homepage which was not useful. I'm still not clear on what happens when I graduate...
Unable to view my documents due to a technical error on the site.  Still to be rectified.
"Good service, offered me car insurance at a lower price than the rest. Although it could not find my car at first and when i did it manually it still did not keep the details."
"I understand data security so understand why, but when I needed to resubmit the payment form due to an error on my part, the credit card number was hashed out - sure, I know why, but it was not highlighted, so resubmitting then prompted this as an error too."
I would like to be able to save a quote and return to it later without having to input all the data again. It may already be possible on your site but if it was I didn't find out how to do it!
Payment page had problems had to enter details about 5 times
"The Payment site crashed at time of submitting payment, so had to come back and try for a second time before payment went through"
TRYING TO GET COPY OF CERTIFICATE ON LINE NOT SUCCESFUL AS YET MAY BE MY COMPUTER AT FAULT WILL TRY AGAIN
"Make insurance cheaper. No honestly! The cheaper the insurance, the people you sign up the more profit youmake so the cheaper the insurance can become and so on."
More competitive premiums for student travel insurance
"I was 'renewing' my travel policy, but there seems to be no way of renewing this, and had to start from scratch. A means of renewing a previous policy would be a benefit. Paul Kelly."
Best way for AY insurer is to realise that existing customers need to be treated fairly EVERY year I have to change the broker as the renewal is at really silly amounts ....don't take the P from renewals
"My Only comment is that I have had numerous phone calls from endsleigh. my son sorted the insurance for me, and gave his telephone number and he has had 4 calls so far."
"Excellent - only reason didn't score maximum was that legal cover was added without me selecting it, which I had to remove myself. Also repeatedly asked to add additional bits, even though each time I chose no. Didn't really like that."
I do not want to be contacted all the time about other services. If I require anything else I will ask for it. Please do not keep sending me emails as this is my work email address
Please don't automatically add the additional items of cover. Explain the benefits and encourage purchase at the time of purchase and after sale.
I would find it easier if you could send me documents as i do not have a printer .Thank you Mrs e. Godwin.
"tried to date the start of my cover to midnight on the 24th april but, it would only allow me to start at 9pm 22nd. as this is two days earlier than i wanted, i'm not that impressed with you drop/down-selection date choice. however the price for the graduate insurance market, was very competitive and if you still have this unique graduate insurance scheme, upon my renewal date in april 2014, i will definitely renew, if you keep your prices for graduates going, it is a unique scheme amongst the vast array of other companies.  so to finish off there are some very annoying issues concerning your starting date selections which should have been ironed out before your system went live, as user testing was a bug bare.  however your graduate scheme is unique in the market place.  ps. any chance of extending my finishing date by two days, because i could only book a date at the latest, two day before i wished commencement of my policy.  kind reagards lucy meehan"
I had to make a UK bank accoun to pay the insurance! I think you should have the option to pay with international cards.
"I would have preferred to pay with a monthly direct debit. However, this was not possible as there is an additional charge. Would be good to provide that to customers at the same cost as one-off annual payment."
Could not find Protected bonus in paper work
Minor uncertainties and confusion induced by the number of pages presented
"I set up a direct debit to pay my insurance, for which I was transferred through to premium credit and requested to sign a credit agreement. This unfortunately was nothing like the experience that I had had with Ensleigh direct. There correspondance was full of unexplained jargon and caused a great deal of anxiety before signing the agreement. My experience of using other companies and setting up direct debits has not been like this and they have been straightforward. This is the only thing I have been disapointed with."
"I think all insurance companies should have a common method of itemising the things offered on their policies, so that it is easier to compare like for like"
It would be better if you had a box to fill in with your email adddress so you could then email the documents straight to yourself.
A quick and easy to use spread sheet app which builds up the estimate of the items that make up the contents. And ditto for re-building costs. And include car garage if this is relevant to the quotation.
cover for lodgers
"Further to my email,the failure to provide an endorsment (in other languages)to the certificate of insurance.This could make life so much easier."
More student advertising
pity the over 80s cannot purchase on line...why?
I am impressed by your online service. It makes it a lot easier to access my policy documets without having tto call. Keep improving.
"I found it quite easy to navigate your online web page but I must say that I was most impressed with the gentleman from your firm that I spoke to a couple of days ago, he was easy to understand and seemed well trained and it was a pleasant experience all round."
I got on with it quiet well
Very helpful and friendly advisor. Much better price than my renewal quote from Aviva too.
very satisfied with transaction
I AM SATISFIED AT THE MOMENT. WHEN I CALL I WOULD KNOW HOW WELL YOUR STAFF HANDLE  QUERIES ON ONE-ONE BASIS.
I have always been pleased. Maybe the proof of the pudding is in the eating? If I ever need to make a claim then I would like to revisit the survey.
I was very happy
very good and easy to understand
All great
Best price for the cover required on a low value old car.
Courteous and efficient.
easily processed
Everything about getting the home and contents insurance that we need was relatively straightforward without unnecessary complication. Well done.
Excellent
excellent service
Excellent telephone help from your agent
gave me the best price for my requirements
Great service excellent price
Have spoken to 2 customer service advisers since becoming a customer of Endsleigh. Very impressed on both occassions with their willingness to help & knowledge when asked to answer specific questions. Many thanks
I have taken out car insurance cover with you because the price is much more favourable than the renewal quote from my previous insurer.  I would like to think that the renewal quote from Endsleigh at this time next year is equally favourable and does not increase in cost.
on 15/02/2013 customer services person rang to confirm additional saving - very pleased with the service
Service was excellent
"so far so good ,early days"
So far very good.  Quick and easy and efficient.
"Telephone call today to confirm some details, I rang back to add RAC cover. Excellent customer service provided, operative was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. (Phil Corkhill, Cheltenham)"
"To me i thought your service was very good,and the lady i conversed with was very understanding keep up the good work."
very clear easy to use website
"very good service ,thanks"
Very Polite and efficient service from laura
Your online website is very easy for new members
A very good service. I am pleased.
"Adam was very helpful on the phone, he was one true professional, easy and clear to understand with out any innuendo which I found with other companies. I wish I could remember his last name. I guess well done to all the Adams out there."
All good already.
All good so far.
CALL BACK SERVICE OFFERED AS I WAS ON MY PHONE. EXCELLENT SERVICE THOUGH. THANKS
Cannot find fault with any aspect of the service I have received so far
Cheap this year which is excellent. Could always be cheaper!
COMPETITIVE QUOTE AND EASY WEBSITE TO USE
"Could not better this service, First rate"
do nothing keep as it is very clear and easy to follow
Easy and trouble free process - thank you.
"Easy to use, and extremely pleased. Thank you."
Endsleigh insurence company is one of the best at all
Endsleigh recognised our long history of not having made any claims.  We were happy to accept their realistic premium.
Every person I spoke to was so friendly and personable it was easy to decide to go with you . Such wonderful staff. Please keep it that way.
"Every year I usually use confused.com to find the cheapest car insurance then buy insurance from that company. Normally once you have filled in all of the forms online you have to then call the company and go through it all again which takes a lot of time and can be frustrating. With your company I could complete the whole process online and didn't have to make a phone call. I was very pleased with this service. Then someone made a quick call to me a couple of days later to confirm that I was insured, they were helpful and didn't try to sell me anything else that I didn't ask for as some companies do. Thank you. I am very pleased with everything."
excellent
excellent
Excellent follow up service as I was phoned to check details and remind me I needed to send evidence of no claims. A very satisfactory experience overall
Excellent online service
Excellent service at a great price! Thank you.
Excellent service at very competitive price .Would get quote for my home insurance when time for renewal.
Excellent service...if price is right would definatly use again
"Exceptional service given when contacted by phone. Better than all other insures I contacted, reason for choosing ensleigh."
"Fantastic, i am quite happy about it. in fact i would like to say that i received a follow up call today asking about i have missed on Rac recovery cover, so added that onto my policy, this really shows how good company is doing while keeping track of who has bought what, every bits and pieces and quite surprised with the staff response as well.  Many thanks i would definitely be recommending the people around my work circle and friends & family.  Regards  Aamir Latif"
Fine so far
"FOR OUR PAST FOUR HOLIDAYS WE HAVE USED YOUR COMPANY,AND TO DATE HAVE ALWAYS FOUND YOU TO BE COMPETITIVE AND VERY HELPFUL.THAT IS WHY WE USE YOU AND RECOMMEND YOU"
Girl on the phone was very friendly and explained all my options clearly.
"Good honest price & efficient service, thankyou"
Good service. Had a call from your centre that I missed but phoned back and no issues experienced. great service

"Had to cancel policy as AA wanted 180 to cancel existing policy although I had only 3 months left with them, robbing sods. As soon as it has expired i will definately be coming back to you for hopefully another good quote."
Happy with service simple time saving
Hard to see any room for improvement!
Have used for years.  Made a claim once which was dealt with efficiently.  Always recommend to friends and family.
"I appreciated the call from your staff to go through the policy to ensure that I had the cover that I wanted. I found this very helpful, as was your member of staff who I spoke to."
"I can't think of anything, because you ticked all the boxes. You rang me to see all was ok which goes along way for customer care so keep it up. Personal contact means a lot as you know your not dealing with just a machine! Thank you"
"i found the site very easy to use and understand, made a nice change"
I had to contact the office to clarify a point and was dealt with most professionally and courteously and was most impressed by the service I received.
"I have no comments,everything was very very good."
I have received excellent service and it was very easy to take out this insurance
"I have used Endsleigh insurance since i was a student, and i have always been very happy with the service. This company is always very professional and helpful. I have recommended this company to all my friends and family."
I liked it that someone called after to check all the details were correct
i think the site serves us well nice and easy and correct
I THINKS AM MORE THAN SATISFY WITH YOUR SERVICE.
I was very pleased with the service I received
If the service by Endsleigh in the year ahead is as good as the arrangements for providing the insurance cover I shall be well pleased.
"If you can improve your service it would be a miracle,I found everything so easy and am very very satisfied,I saved a packet with your company,I have already recommended you to Family and Friends,I don't think your service can be beaten,Thank you ENDSLIEGH."
It seems like a very competent set up that you have.
It was all very clear. Thank you
"It was quick, easy and simple, was all companies were the same."
"it's fine so far, thank you"

Received excellence service
Service is good
"Service was excellent, very happy with the price. Also nice call from your call centre."
"Service was very good as always,the only thing I needed clarified was the extra medical cover, but once I had telephoned(for my last ins) it was very clear many thanks for years of excellent service."
Services are fine
Telephone service was very helpful the member of staff was extremly friendly and had great knowledge on the car insurance I was provided
The 2000 nectar points were a great incentive to start the quote.
"The agent I spoke to was excellent, based on the internet alone, I may have no purchased your policy, however, after speaking with the agent I was able to ask the necessary questions in order to decide to take the policy"
The fact that u have an app on an insurance policy so I can view all my documents on the go is great. Thanks
"top notch service, fantastic price. keep doing what your doing. many thanks."
Totally satisfied
uncomplicated and quick
very easy and pleasant transaction very straight forward

When I phoned to clarify cover valid for motorcycle travel the young lady on the other end delivered great customer service. Very helpful and polite.
You are doing a very good job. Thank you
Your phone service which I have used in the past was also very good.
"Your site is the easiest i have ever found for quoting and purchasing home insurance. The quote was quick to complete due to the set up of the form, with helpful information at questions usually tricky to complete (in terms of property build etc). I didn't purchase straight away so had to come back and retrieve my quote. Was v easy to change the start date and remove one of the covers, not having to go through the whole form again. Log in after purchase was v easy and logically set out - i didn't need to search for what i wanted, my eye was drawn to the relevant bits."
We have used endsleigh now for the past 5 holidays we have taken.  Think that says it all.  Thank you.
it took me a long time becuase  I am inexperienced with online stuff and make silly errors/omissions etc.. and using library computers  rather than at home
My problems were due to a fraud check and not your site.
The only reason I have not given the highest marks throughout is that I am really quite computer illiterate.  Your site is no more difficult than any other; just that I'm not very good at them!

No criticism. In fact the renewal quote from HSBC was 390 for the same cover. The only difference is that the HSBC insurance quoted a less excess charge but I accept that as the Endesleigh overall quote is so much cheaper. I feel aggrieved that as a long standing customer of HSBC they did not take this  into accout and also that I have never made a claim with them or any other Insurer.
None
nothing to add
The main reason I opted to go with you was based on price and cover of which you came top in my search on moneysupermarket.com - if I hadn't searched this site I probably would've ever thought to come with you.
These results are based on the first day of Insurance
