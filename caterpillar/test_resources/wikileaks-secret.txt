Negotiators' Note: MY supports this article subject to further domestic implementation. [JP propose: For clarity a Party may require that a sign has acquired distinctiveness through use, where the sign consists only of names of place.] For purposes of this Chapter, geographical indication means indications that identify a good as originating in the territory of a party, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation, or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin.

Article QQ.C.4: Each Party may provide limited exceptions to the rights conferred by a trademark, such as fair use of descriptive terms, provided that such exceptions take account of the legitimate interest of the owner of the trademark and of third parties. [VN propose; AU/US/NZ/SG/MY/CL/PE/CA/JP/BN oppose: The owner of a registered trademark shall not have the right to prevent third parties from using geographical indications or other signs descriptive of goods and services even though they are identical or similar to the trademark unless such use would result in confusion.]47 Article QQ.C.5: {Well Known Trademarks}

Article QQ.E.19: Where a Party chooses to apply subparagraph 6(e) of Article 8 and paragraphs 4 and 6 of this Article, the following provisions shall apply: (a) a Party shall permit an applicant to commence the process of obtaining marketing approval by providing the regulatory authority of the Party information supporting approval of the new pharmaceutical product in the Party that is available to the person at the time the request is made, such as evidence of the prior approval of the product in another Party. It is understood that, while a Party may impose reasonable additional requirements or deadlines as a condition of authorizing the person to market the pharmaceutical product in its territory, satisfaction of those additional requirements or deadlines or the granting of approval shall be recognized by the Party as necessarily occurring after the commencement of the marketing approval process within the meaning of subparagraph 6(e) of Article 8 and paragraphs 4 and 6 of this Article; and a Party may not refuse to grant approval of a new pharmaceutical product on the basis of a failure of an applicant for marketing approval to satisfy the requirements of subparagraph 6(e) of Article 8 or paragraphs 4 and 6 of this Article.

Article QQ.G.5: Each Party shall provide that in cases where authorization is needed from both the author of a work embodied in a phonogram and a performer or producer owning rights in the phonogram, the need for the authorization of the author does not cease to exist because the authorization of the performer or producer is also required. Likewise, each Party shall provide that in cases where authorization is needed from both the author of a work embodied in a phonogram and a performer or producer owning rights in the phonogram, the need for the authorization of the performer or producer does not cease to exist because the authorization of the author is also required.

The term “published” in this paragraph includes phonograms that are made available in accordance with Article 15(4) of the WPPT. Where a Party has availed itself of the option contained in Article 15(3) of the World Intellectual Property Organization Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT), the obligation contained in [QQ.A.X – national treatment] does not apply to the extent that a Party makes use of a reservation taken under that Article.]”

Article QQ.G.15: For purposes of this [Article QQ.G.1 and Article QQ.G.3 – 18 ], the following definitions apply with respect to performers and producers of phonograms: (a) broadcasting means the transmission by wireless means for public reception of sounds or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof; such transmission by satellite is also “broadcasting”; transmission of encrypted signals is “broadcasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the broadcasting organization or with its consent177; communication to the public of a performance or a phonogram means the transmission to the public by any medium, other than by broadcasting, of sounds of a performance or the sounds or the representations of sounds fixed in a phonogram. For the purposes of paragraph [3], “communication to the public” includes making the sounds or representations of sounds fixed in a phonogram audible to the public; fixation means the embodiment of sounds, or of the representations thereof, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or communicated through a device; performers means actors, singers, musicians, dancers and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret, or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; phonogram means the fixation of the sounds of a performance or of other sounds, or of a representation of sounds, other than in the form of a fixation incorporated in a cinematographic or other audiovisual work; producer of a phonogram means the person who, or the legal entity which, takes the initiative and has the responsibility for the first fixation of the sounds of a performance or other sounds, or the representations of sounds; and [CA propose:178]publication of a performance or a phonogram means the offering of copies of the performance or the phonogram to the public,

Delegations will work to resolve this issue in Article QQ.A.6 (General Provisions – relationship to other agreements) or elsewhere. Negotiator's Note: SG/CA/PE/BN/NZ/AU is flexible on the inclusion of the word 'education' as the notion is already significantly covered by teaching, sholarship and research. US/MX believe the word 'education' is covered by teaching, scholarship and research, but is considering further.

These procedures shall be applied in such a manner as to avoid the creation of barriers to legitimate trade and to provide for safeguards against their abuse. 2. Each Party shall ensure that its procedures concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights shall be fair and equitable. These procedures shall not be unnecessarily complicated or costly, or entail unreasonable time-limits or unwarranted delays. [CL/VN/PE/AU/MY/BN/NZ/SG/MX/CA propose: 3. This Section does not create any obligation: (a) to put in place a judicial system for the enforcement of intellectual property rights distinct from that for the enforcement of law in general, nor does it affect the capacity of each Party to enforce their law in general, or with respect to the distribution of resources as between the enforcement of intellectual property rights and the enforcement of law in general.]

The term “authorized licensee” shall include the exclusive licensee of any one or more of the exclusive intellectual property rights encompassed in a given intellectual property. Negotiators' Note: AU/US/JP would like to consider this proposal in tandem with the definition of intellectual property rights in this Chapter. [AU/NZ/MY/CA/JP/SG propose: A Party may also provide that the right holder may not be entitled to either of the remedies set out in 2 and 2bis in the case of a finding of non-use of a trademark] [JP/AU/SG/CA/MY propose: it is understood that there is no obligation for a Party to provide for the possibility of the remedies in 2 and 2bis to be ordered in parallel.] [US propose: In the case of patent infringement, damages adequate to compensate for the infringement shall not be less than a reasonable royalty.] [Negotiators' note: JP can go along with consensus.]

[CA propose: A Party may exclude from the application of this Article cases of Copyright or related rights infringement where an infringer did not knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engage in infringing activity or where an infringer is a non-profit entity.][JP propose: A Party may presume those profits to be the amount of damages referred to in the preceding paragraph.] Negotiators' Note: AU supports this paragraph ad referendum. Negotiators' Note: CL/MY/SG will revert back intersessionally. Negotiators' Note: JP is considering this provision.

In civil judicial proceedings concerning copyright or related rights infringement

Negotiator's Note: AU is still considering this paragaph. Negotiators' Note: Parties are considering the drafting choice of the word that represent the concept of seriousness. No Party shall be required to apply this paragraph to actions for infringement against a Party or a third party acting with the authorization or consent of a Party. [CA propose: For the purposes of this Article, where appropriate shall not be limited to exceptional cases.] Negotiators note: NZ share view of the article but would rather see it placed some other place; MX is considering this issue in light of Article QQ.H.4.13; JP proposes to move paragraph. 9 to Article QQ.H.5. Otherwise, JP will support VN proposal.

Each Party shall provide that in civil judicial proceedings: (a) At least with respect to pirated copyright goods and counterfeit trademark goods, each Party shall provide that, in civil judicial proceedings, at the right holder's request, its judicial authorities have the authority to order that such infringing goods be [VN propose: disposed of outside the channel of commerce or] destroyed, except in exceptional circumstances, without compensation of any sort. (b) Each Party shall further provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to order that materials and implements that have been used in the manufacture or creation of such infringing goods, be, without undue delay and without compensation of any sort, destroyed or disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to minimize the risks of further infringements. (c) in regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient, other than in exceptional circumstances, to permit the release of goods into the channels of commerce. 11212. Without prejudice to its law governing privilege, the protection of confidentiality of information sources, or the processing of personal data, each Party shall provide that, in civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights, its judicial authorities have the authority, upon a justified request [VN: propose213] of the right holder, to order the infringer or, in the alternative, the alleged infringer, to provide to the right holder or to the judicial authorities, at least for the purpose of collecting evidence, relevant information as provided for in its applicable laws and regulations that the infringer or alleged infringer possesses or controls. Such information may include information regarding any person involved in any aspect of the infringement or alleged infringement and regarding the means of production or the channels of distribution of the infringing or allegedly infringing goods or services, including the identification of third persons alleged to be involved
211 212 213

Negotiator's Note: MX supports this in principle but needs to reflect on this pending discussions on paragraph QQ.H.4.13. Negotiator's Note: MX is still considering this proposal. VN propose: A request for an order under this paragraph may be considered as unjustified in case such order would be out of proportion to the seriousness of the infringement.

Each Party shall provide that in relation to a civil judicial proceeding concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights, its judicial or other authorities have the authority to impose sanctions on a party, counsel, experts, or other persons subject to the court's jurisdiction, for violation of judicial orders concerning the protection of confidential information produced or exchanged in connection with such a proceeding. 214 13.

In the event that a Party's judicial or other authorities appoint technical or other experts in civil proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights and require that the parties to the litigation bear the costs of such experts, that Party should seek to ensure that such costs are reasonable and related appropriately, inter alia, to the quantity and nature of work to be performed and do not unreasonably deter recourse to such proceedings. [US/AU/SG propose; BN/VN/MX/JP oppose216: 15. In civil judicial proceedings concerning the acts described in Article 4.[9] (TPMs) and Article 4.[10] (RMI), each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall, at the least, have the authoriy to: (a) impose provisional measures, including seizure or other taking into custody of devices and products suspected of being involved in the prohibited activity; (b) [US/SG propose; NZ/AU/MY oppose: provide an opportunity for the right holder to elect between actual damages it suffered (plus any profits attributable to the prohibited activity not taken into account in computing those damages) or pre-established damages;] [AU/NZ/PE propose: order damages of the type available for the infringement of copyright]

Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to require the applicant, with respect to provisional measures, to provide any reasonably available evidence in order to satisfy themselves with a sufficient degree of certainty that the applicant's right is being infringed or that such infringement is imminent, [VN//PE: and that any delay in the issuance of such measures is likely to cause irreparable harm to the right holders, or there is a demonstrable risk of evidence being destroyed,] and to order the applicant to provide a security or equivalent assurance set at a level sufficient to protect the defendant and to prevent abuse. Such security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to such procedures.

Negotiator's Note: This will be discussed in relation to provisions regarding TPM and RMI. Negotiators Note: The scope of border measures in this section will be confined to counterfeit trademark goods, pirated copyright goods. The US proposal for inclusion of, confusingly similar trademark goods is still under negotiation and Parties have different views on this proposal.

1. Each Party shall provide that any right holder initiating procedures for its competent authorities to suspend release of suspected counterfeit [SG/BN/MY/VN/CA oppose: or confusingly similar] trademark goods, or pirated copyright goods 220 into free circulation is required to provide adequate evidence to satisfy the competent authorities that, under the law{s} of the [CA/NZ/MX/US/PE/AU oppose: country of importation] [CA/NZ/MX/US/PE/AU221 propose: Party providing the procedures], there is prima facie an infringement of the right holder's intellectual property right and to supply sufficient information that may reasonably be expected to be within the right holder's knowledge to make the suspected goods 222reasonably recognizable by its competent authorities. The requirement to provide such information shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures. 1bis. Each Party shall provide for applications to suspend the release of, or to detain, any suspect goods 223 [SG/VN oppose: under customs control 224 in its territory.] [SG/VN propose: that are imported into the territory of the Party 225] A Party may provide that, at the request of the right holder, an application to suspend the release of, or to detain, suspect goods may apply to selected points of entry [US/CA/JP/MX 226 propose; CL/SG/VN oppose: and exit] under customs control.] 227 228 [US/AU/CA/JP/NZ propose; MX /PE/CL/MY/SG/VN/BN oppose: Each Party shall provide that applications [NZ oppose: shall] remain in force [NZ propose: for the period requested by the right holder but not exceeding five years, or] for a period of not less than one year from the date of application, or the period that the good is protected by copyright or the relevant trademark registration is valid, whichever is shorter.[NZ propose: A Party may provide that its competent authorities have the authority to suspend or invalidate an application when there is due cause.]
220

For purposes of Article 14: (a) counterfeit trademark goods means any goods, including packaging, bearing without authorization a trademark that is identical to the trademark validly registered in respect of such goods, or that cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from such a trademark, and that thereby infringes the rights of the owner of the trademark in quesiton under the law of the country of importation; and (b) pirated copyright goods means any goods that are copies made without the consent of the right holder or person duly authorized by the right holder in the country of production and that are made directly or indirectly from an article where the making of that copy would have constituted an infringement of a copyright or a related right under the law of the country of importation. 221 Negotiators' Note: AU supports this ad referendum. 222 Negotiators' Note: Need to clean up terminology in H.6 relating to 'goods' and 'merchandise'. 223 Negotiators' Note: MY/CA/SG/AU/VN/BN: suspect goods need to be defined and revert back. 224 Negotiators' Note: CA/MY/AU: Customs controls need to be defined and revert back. 225 [SG propose: the requirement to provide for such application is applicable to the obligation to provide procedures referred to in Article QQ.H.6.1.] 226 Negotiators' Note: AU/PE can support consensus. 227 Negotiators' Note: MY/SG/VN/BN are considering this first clause. 228 Negotiators' Note: Parties are considering the need for a footnote to deal with the scope of this clause.

Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities have the authority to require a right holder initiating procedures to suspend the release of suspected counterfeit [BN/SG/MY/VN/CA oppose: or confusingly similar] trademark goods, or pirated copyright goods, to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse. Each Party shall provide that such security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures. A Party may provide that such security may be in the form of a bond conditioned to hold the defendant harmless from any loss or damage resulting from any suspension of the release of goods in the event the competent authorities determine that the article is not an infringing good. 3. Without prejudice to a Party's laws pertaining to privacy or the confidentiality of information, where its competent authorities have detained or suspended the release of goods that are suspected of being counterfeit or pirated, a Party may provide that its competent authorities have the authority to inform the right holder [CA/VN propose: who has filed a request for assistance] [MY/CA/BN/PE/VN oppose: promptly] [MY/CA/PE229 /BN/SG/VN propose: within a reasonable period] of the names and addresses of the consignor, exporter, consignee or importer, a description of the merchandise, quantity of the merchandise, and, if known, the country of origin of the merchandise.: Where a Party does not provide such authority to its competent authorities when suspect goods are detained or suspended from release, it shall provide [US/VN propose: , at least in cases of imported goods,] its competent authorities with the authority to provide the foregoing information to the right holder [SG/VN oppose: within 30 days230] [SG/VN propose: within a reasonable period] of the seizure or determination that the goods are counterfeit or pirated, whichever is earlier.

Each Party shall adopt or maintain a procedure by which its competent authorities may determine, within a reasonable period of time after the initiation of the procedures described under Article QQ.H.6(1)233 whether the suspect goods infringe an intellectual property right. Where a Party provides administrative procedures for the determination of an infringement, it [VN 234 propose: may] [VN oppose: shall] also provide its authorities with the authority to impose administrative penalties, which may include monetary penalties or the seizure of the infringing goods, following a determination that the goods are infringing. 6. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities have the authority to order the destruction [VN propose: , or disposal outside the channel of commerce,] of goods following a determination that the goods are infringing. In cases where such goods are not destroyed, each Party shall ensure that, except in exceptional circumstances, such goods are disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid any harm to the right holder. In regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient, other than in exceptional cases, to permit the release of the goods into the channels of commerce. 7. Where a Party establishes or assesses, in connection with the procedures described in this section [article], an application fee, storage fee, or destruction fee, such fee shall not be set at an amount that unreasonably deters recourse to these procedures
8. Each Party shall include in the application of this Article goods of a commercial nature sent in small consignments. A Party may exclude from the application of this Article small quantities of goods of a non-commercial nature contained in travellers' personal luggage.235

With respect to the offenses for which this Article requires the Parties to provide for criminal procedures and penalties, Parties shall ensure that criminal liability for aiding and abetting is available under its law. 7. With respect to the offences described in Article QQ.H.7[1]-[4] above, each Party shall provide:

that its judicial authorities shall have the authority, when determining penalties, to account for the seriousness of the circumstances, which may include those that involve threats to, or effects on, health or safety;245 that its judicial [VN propose: or other]authorities shall have the authority to order the seizure of suspected counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods, any related materials and implements used in the commission of the alleged offense, documentary evidence relevant to the alleged offense [MY oppose: , and assets 246 derived from, or obtained directly [VN oppose: or indirectly] through the alleged infringing activity].

(c)

It is understood that there is no obligation for a Party to provide for the possibility of imprisonment and monetary fines to be imposed in parallel. Negotiator's Note: CL/PE/MX/CA is still considering pending consultation with capital. A Party may also account for such circumstances through a separate criminal offense. Negotiators' Note: CA/BN/VN are reflecting on the definition of “assets”.

Where a Party requires the identification of items subject to seizure as a prerequisite for issuing any such judicial order, that Party shall not require the items to be described in greater detail than necessary to identify them for the purpose of seizure; (d) that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the forfeiture, at least for serious offenses, of any assets derived from, or obtained directly [VN oppose: or indirectly] through the infringing activity; that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the forfeiture or destruction of: (i) (ii) all counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods; and materials and implements [CA/VN/MX propose: predominantly] [CA/VN/MX oppose: that have been] used in the creation of pirated copyright goods or counterfeit trademark goods; and

Article QQ.H.8 {Trade Secrets} 1.250[CL propose: In the course of ensuring effective protection against unfair competition as provided in Article 10bis of the Paris Convention] Parties shall ensure that natural and legal persons have the legal means to prevent trade secrets lawfully in their control from being disclosed to, acquired by, or used by others (including state commercial enterprises) 251 without their consent in a manner contrary to honest commercial practices.[ 252 ] As used in this Chapter, trade secrets encompass, at a minimum, undisclosed information as provided for in Article 39.2 of the TRIPS Agreement. [US/MX/CA/NZ/JP253 propose; SG/MY/PE/VN/CL/AU254/BN oppose: 2. Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties at least in cases in which a trade secret relating to a product in national or international commerce is misappropriated, or disclosed, willfully and without authority for purposes of commercial advantage or financial gain, and with the intent to injure the owner of such trade secret.] Article QQ.H.9: {Protection of Encrypted Program-Carrying Satellite Signals/Protection of Encrypted Program-Carrying Satellite and Cable Signals} 1.

A Party may also provide such authority in connection with administrative infringement proceedings. Negotiators' Note: AU supports this paragraph ad referendum. Negotiators' Note: BN seeks further clarification on “state commercial enterprise”. [US: For greater certainty, a Party may treat disclosure of a trade secret to that Party's authorities in connection with providing evidence of an alleged violation of that Party's law as not contrary to honest commercial practices.][AU propose: for the purposes of this paragraph “a manner contrary to honest commercial practices” shall mean at least practices such as breach of contract, breach of confidence and inducement to breach, and includes the acquisition of undisclosed information by third parties who knew, or were grossly negligent in failing to know, that such practices were involved in the acquisition.] Negotiators' Note: CA/MX/NZ/JP supports in principle subject to final drafting.

Negotiators' Note: CA support for central depends on how it is defined throughout the agreement. Negotiators' Note: SG/CL/MY/BN/VN subject to consideration of parallel importation issues. Negotiators' Note: delegations are still considering this proposal, and are also reflecting on the placement of this proposal in the Chapter. [US: For purposes of this Article and for greater certainty, retransmission within a Party's territory over a closed, defined, subscriber network that is not accessible from outside the Party's territory does not constitute retransmission on the Internet.]

Limitations referred to in the previous paragraph shall cover at least the following functions: a. mere conduit, which consist of the provision of the means to transmit information provided by a user, or the means of access to a communication network; b. hosting of information at the request of a user of the hosting services; c. caching carried out through an automated process, when the internet service provider: i. does not modify information other than for technical reasons; ii. ensures that any directions related to the caching of information that are specified in a manner widely recognized and used by industry are complied with; and iii. does not interfere with the use of technology that is lawful and widely recognized and used by the industry in order to obtain data on the use of information; d. providing an information location tool, by making reproductions of copyright material in an automated manner, and communicating the reproductions.] [CA propose: 3. Qualification by an internet service provider for the limitations as to each function in the previous paragraph shall be considered separately from qualification for the limitations as to each other function. Eligibility for the limitations in the previous paragraph may not be conditioned on the internet service provider monitoring its service, or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity.]
